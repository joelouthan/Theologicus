# Code of Conduct

## The Introduction

Hello and welcome to [Theologicus](https://theologic.us/)! My name is Joseph Louthan, the sole proprietor and I am thrilled to have you here.

By simply taking a quick glance at the content therein, you can quickly see that [Theologicus](https://theologic.us/) is a small collection of my personal thoughts on God. These writings are from a specific perspective, namely:

- Christian
- Reformed Baptist ([1689 2LBC](https://theologic.us/confession-1689/))
- theologically classic
- theologically conservative
- historically orthodox

To that end, this project is Open Source. Open Source is a collaborative approach that allows anyone to freely use, modify, and distribute the project's resources, fostering innovation and community development.

Since this project is Open Source and therefore, is open to collaboration, there is a need for a Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct is designed to ensure a supportive and inclusive environment for everyone involved. My goal is to foster an open and welcoming community where contributors of all backgrounds feel safe to participate, share ideas, and collaborate effectively.

## The Standards

In the pursuit of creating a positive environment, I encourage the following behaviors:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities

For the moment, I am the sole project maintainer. So it is my responsibility for clarifying and enforcing these standards of acceptable behavior. I have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, as well as in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team at any of the following contacts:
