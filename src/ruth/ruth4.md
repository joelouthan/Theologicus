# Ruth 4 God Brings Us All The Way Home

>Ruth 4 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> Boaz went to the gate of the town and sat down there. Soon the family redeemer Boaz had spoken about came by. Boaz said, “Come over here and sit down.” So he went over and sat down.
>
><sup>2</sup> Then Boaz took ten men of the town’s elders and said, “Sit here.” And they sat down.
>
><sup>3</sup> He said to the redeemer, “Naomi, who has returned from the territory of Moab, is selling the portion of the field that belonged to our brother Elimelech.
>
><sup>4</sup> I thought I should inform you: Buy it back in the presence of those seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you want to redeem it, do it. But if you do not want to redeem it, tell me so that I will know, because there isn’t anyone other than you to redeem it, and I am next after you.” “I want to redeem it,” he answered.
>
><sup>5</sup> Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the field from Naomi, you will acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the deceased man, to perpetuate the man’s name on his property.”
>
><sup>6</sup> The redeemer replied, “I can’t redeem it myself, or I will ruin my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption, because I can’t redeem it.”
>
><sup>7</sup> At an earlier period in Israel, a man removed his sandal and gave it to the other party in order to make any matter legally binding concerning the right of redemption or the exchange of property. This was the method of legally binding a transaction in Israel.
>
><sup>8</sup> So the redeemer removed his sandal and said to Boaz, “Buy back the property yourself.”
>
><sup>9</sup> Boaz said to the elders and all the people, “You are witnesses today that I am buying from Naomi everything that belonged to Elimelech, Chilion, and Mahlon.
>
><sup>10</sup> I have also acquired Ruth the Moabitess, Mahlon’s widow, as my wife, to perpetuate the deceased man’s name on his property, so that his name will not disappear among his relatives or from the gate of his hometown. You are witnesses today.”
>
><sup>11</sup> All the people who were at the city gate, including the elders, said, “We are witnesses. May the LORD make the woman who is entering your house like Rachel and Leah, who together built the house of Israel. May you be powerful in Ephrathah and your name well known in Bethlehem.
>
><sup>12</sup> May your house become like the house of Perez, the son Tamar bore to Judah, because of the offspring the LORD will give you by this young woman.”
>
><sup>13</sup> Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. He slept with her, and the LORD granted conception to her, and she gave birth to a son.
>
><sup>14</sup> The women said to Naomi, “Blessed be the LORD, who has not left you without a family redeemer today. May his name become well known in Israel.
>
><sup>15</sup> He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age. Indeed, your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons, has given birth to him.”
>
><sup>16</sup> Naomi took the child, placed him on her lap, and became a mother to him.
>
><sup>17</sup> The neighbor women said, “A son has been born to Naomi,” and they named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David.
>
><sup>18</sup> Now these are the family records of Perez: Perez fathered Hezron,

><sup>19</sup> Hezron fathered Ram, Ram fathered Amminadab,

## The First Redeemer: The Closer Kinsmen

### God Does: God accomplishes his purposes

><sup>1-2</sup> Boaz went to the gate of the town and sat down there. Soon the family redeemer Boaz had spoken about came by. Boaz said, “Come over here and sit down.” So he went over and sat down. Then Boaz took ten men of the town’s elders and said, “Sit here.” And they sat down.

- The Covenant of Redemption to the cross of Christ
- No means is can it be reduced to like a business matter or a legal transaction
- But make no mistake: God took action, step-by-step, in the background, foreground and through mankind, in order to accomplish his purposes

### God Does: God wants to not because it was the easiest path

><sup>3-4</sup> He said to the redeemer, “Naomi, who has returned from the territory of Moab, is selling the portion of the field that belonged to our brother Elimelech. I thought I should inform you: Buy it back in the presence of those seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you want to redeem it, do it. But if you do not want to redeem it, tell me so that I will know, because there isn’t anyone other than you to redeem it, and I am next after you.” “I want to redeem it,” he answered.

- not necessarily the bad guy
- shrewd, wise
- considered the cost 
- safe bet
- the deal on paper made total sense
- determining the will of God especially when it comes to ministering to others
  - Read the Scriptures
  - seek godly counsel
  - exercise wisdom and prudence
  - Reading of missionaries and biographies of Christians who have gone before us: so risky so bold so dangerous--but Christians before us read the Scriptures, sought counsel, exercised wisdom and prudence, counted the cost, and then went out and did it

### God Does: God wants to do what is necessary because he loves us

><sup>5-6</sup> Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the field from Naomi, you will acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the deceased man, to perpetuate the man’s name on his property.” The redeemer replied, “I can’t redeem it myself, or I will ruin my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption, because I can’t redeem it.”

- redeemer marries widow
- yet their son will inherit his deceased dad's property

<hr style="clear:both;">

## The Second Redeemer: Boaz

### God Does: Legally saves us

><sup>7-9</sup> At an earlier period in Israel, a man removed his sandal and gave it to the other party in order to make any matter legally binding concerning the right of redemption or the exchange of property. This was the method of legally binding a transaction in Israel. So the redeemer removed his sandal and said to Boaz, “Buy back the property yourself.” Boaz said to the elders and all the people, “You are witnesses today that I am buying from Naomi everything that belonged to Elimelech, Chilion, and Mahlon.

Again, not to reduce the work of God down to a business or legal matter but the analogies do work.

>1 Corinthians 6:19-20 (CSB) Don’t you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were bought at a price. So glorify God with your body.

>Colossians 2:14 (CSB) He erased the certificate of debt, with its obligations, that was against us and opposed to us, and has taken it away by nailing it to the cross.

>1 Peter 1:18-19 (CSB) For you know that you were redeemed from your empty way of life inherited from your fathers, not with perishable things like silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of an unblemished and spotless lamb.

We have been redeemed and justified by Christ. Because of our sins, we needed to be saved and only Christ, our Kinsmen Redeemer could do it, was willing to do it, had the power to do it and actually did it.

We often use the analogy of redemption and justification in legal terms. We do so because of our sake, there was a trial.

>Matthew 27:20-22 (CSB) The chief priests and the elders, however, persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to execute Jesus. The governor asked them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you? ”  
>“Barabbas! ” they answered.  
>Pilate asked them, “What should I do then with Jesus, who is  called Christ? ”  
>They all answered, “Crucify him! ”

Barabbas is us and Christ is Christ!

### God Does: God will never forget us nor forsake us

><sup>10</sup> I have also acquired Ruth the Moabitess, Mahlon’s widow, as my wife, to perpetuate the deceased man’s name on his property, so that his name will not disappear among his relatives or from the gate of his hometown. You are witnesses today.”

- this was so that the name of the dead would not be forgotten nor blotted out
- The grace of God in his law
- The law of God is good and holy and righteous
- The law of God does not save us
- The law of God is a reflection of the character of God
- The law represents our condemnation, his holiness, and his grace
- Boaz: obeyed the law of God so that Mahlon's name would not be blotted out from existence
- The gospel of God so that our names are in the book of life

>Revelation 21:22-27 (CSB) I did not see a temple in it, because the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, because the glory of God illuminates it, and its lamp is the Lamb. The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it. Its gates will never close by day because it will never be night there. They will bring the glory and honor of the nations into it. Nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who does what is detestable or false, but only those written in the Lamb’s book of life.

### God Does: God is in every part of your life

><sup>11</sup> All the people who were at the city gate, including the elders, said, “We are witnesses. May the LORD make the woman who is entering your house like Rachel and Leah, who together built the house of Israel. May you be powerful in Ephrathah and your name well known in Bethlehem. May your house become like the house of Perez, the son Tamar bore to Judah, because of the offspring the LORD will give you by this young woman.”

- the blessing of the Lord from the people
- the odd comparison between Tamar and Ruth
  - Tamar's deception in order to have a child
  - Ruth's humility in order to have a child
  - make no mistake: Judah grievously sin against Tamar and his family by sleeping with temple prostitute
  - yet both instances, God blessed the family line
  - despite our best efforts, God redeems and glorifies

### God Does: God is at the forefront of our lives

><sup>13</sup> Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. He slept with her, and the LORD granted conception to her, and she gave birth to a son.

- provision is always 20/20
- God withheld conception from Ruth and Mahlon during their 10 years of marriage
- God granted conception to Ruth and Boaz

It is any wonder why David writes:

>Psalms 139:13-14 (CSB) For it was you who created my inward parts; you knit me together in my mother’s womb.I will praise you because I have been remarkably and wondrously made. Your works are wondrous, and I know this very well.

### God Does: God redeems

><sup>14-15</sup> The women said to Naomi, “Blessed be the LORD, who has not left you without a family redeemer today. May his name become well known in Israel. He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age. Indeed, your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons, has given birth to him.”

<hr style="clear:both;">

## The Third Redeemer: Grandfather of David

### God Does: God is our joy

><sup>16-17</sup> Naomi took the child, placed him on her lap, and became a mother to him. The neighbor women said, “A son has been born to Naomi,” and they named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David.

Naomi's life redeemed. She did not perish but the joy of the Lord was her strength. She was emptied and embittered against God. But despite her bitterness, God was still at work. God had tender mercies on her and did not forget her, forsake her but redeem her.

I tell you time and time again, I identify will nobody in this story other than Naomi. I am Naomi but times a million. I have sinned mightily against God. Because of my sin, I have stepped into the deepest darkest despair. But my God did not forget me nor forsake me. He knew I was a wicked man and when he saw me before the foundation of the world, he saw that I was dead in my trespasses and sins. But it was there, before the beginning, he made a covenant with the Son that he will not let me nor you see corruption nor dwell in hell but save us to himself forever.

## The Fourth Redeemer: The Son of David

### God Does: Gives us our only Redeemer

In the midst of chaos (Judges), when our world seems to be at our bleakest darkest moment, God is telling us that he is still at work. He is the not the divine watchmaker who wound up the universe like a watch and then left it to run on its own. Likewise, despite the idiom, the devil is not in the details. We see over and over again that God is in the details.

><sup>18</sup> Now these are the family records of Perez: Perez fathered Hezron,
>
><sup>19</sup> Hezron fathered Ram, Ram fathered Amminadab,
>
><sup>20</sup> Amminadab fathered Nahshon, Nahshon fathered Salmon,
>
><sup>21</sup> Salmon fathered Boaz, Boaz fathered Obed,
>
><sup>22</sup> Obed fathered Jesse, and Jesse fathered David.

>Matthew 1:5-6 (CSB) Salmon fathered Boaz by Rahab,  
>Boaz fathered Obed by Ruth,
>Obed fathered Jesse,  
>and Jesse fathered King David.

We know that Boaz is a godly man who was raised up in a godly way. We know that he heard the law of God and strived not to simply obey the letter but the spirit of the law. Think about this: who taught him that.

Look at his mother, Rahab. Boaz' mother, at one time, was an outsider Gentile like Ruth. Unlike Ruth who is woman of godly character (Proverbs 31), Rahab started her life the complete opposite--she was a prostitute and a Canaanite. But in a moment that change not only the life of Rahab but for the people of Israel, Rahab believed in God, it was counted to her as righteousness, and she acted upon that faith.

Boaz was a direct result of the people of God being obedient to God to protect and redeem Rahab and her family from harm. The God's judgment was on Jericho. That was not going to be deterred. But the redemption of salvation on Rahab and her household was not going to be thwarted either.

Boaz grew up the compassion of God to him. Boaz and his family were sinners saved by the grace of God whose mercies are fresh every morning. The story of Ruth is all about God's love for us. But in the smallest details, I have always wondered if Boaz loved Ruth because her story reminded him of his mom's story.

>Matthew 1:16 (CSB) and Jacob fathered Joseph the husband of Mary, who gave birth to Jesus who is called the Messiah.

>Matthew 1:21 (CSB) She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”

Our story is just like Ruths. Instead of being the middle of the book of Judges, we are in the middle of Genesis 3. In the middle of this story, God has sent us the Redeemer--his only begotten Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, the Son of David, the Son of Jesse, the Son of Obed, the Son of Ruth and Boaz.

While Ruth and Naomi did not know how their lives were going to end up, they put all of their hope in the God that saves. For us who believe in God, we know how the story ends: the new heavens and the new earth and Christ glorified us his people.

>Revelation 21:3-4 (CSB) Then I heard a loud voice from the throne: Look, God’s dwelling is with humanity, and he will live with them. They will be his peoples, and God himself will be with them and will be their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; grief, crying, and pain will be no more, because the previous things have passed away.

Nothing in all of creation can separate us from the love of God because Jesus Christ is our Lord.

We all want the end like Ruth 4. But I am telling you will receive something way way more beautiful and glorious: we get to dwell with the Triune God forever because the Triune God dwells in us now!

But from where we are at now to Revelation 22, how do we get there? That, my beloved, is the Christian life. I am not sure what we are all going through--in our hearts and souls, what is really really going on. But I assume you by the promises of God, you are preserved and healed and made whole and made new in his Son. God's promises is that he alone will bring us all the way home. That is the Christian life. That is the life of faith. That is the life of pilgrim. That is the life of the redeemed.
