# Ruth 4:1-10 God Redeems Us Forever, Part 1

>Ruth 4:1-10 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> Boaz went to the gate of the town and sat down there. Soon the family redeemer Boaz had spoken about came by. Boaz said, “Come over here and sit down.” So he went over and sat down.
>
><sup>2</sup> Then Boaz took ten men of the town’s elders and said, “Sit here.” And they sat down.
>
><sup>3</sup> He said to the redeemer, “Naomi, who has returned from the territory of Moab, is selling the portion of the field that belonged to our brother Elimelech.
>
><sup>4</sup> I thought I should inform you: Buy it back in the presence of those seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you want to redeem it, do it. But if you do not want to redeem it, tell me so that I will know, because there isn’t anyone other than you to redeem it, and I am next after you.” “I want to redeem it,” he answered.
>
><sup>5</sup> Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the field from Naomi, you will acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the deceased man, to perpetuate the man’s name on his property.”
>
><sup>6</sup> The redeemer replied, “I can’t redeem it myself, or I will ruin my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption, because I can’t redeem it.”
>
><sup>7</sup> At an earlier period in Israel, a man removed his sandal and gave it to the other party in order to make any matter legally binding concerning the right of redemption or the exchange of property. This was the method of legally binding a transaction in Israel.
>
><sup>8</sup> So the redeemer removed his sandal and said to Boaz, “Buy back the property yourself.”
>
><sup>9</sup> Boaz said to the elders and all the people, “You are witnesses today that I am buying from Naomi everything that belonged to Elimelech, Chilion, and Mahlon.
>
><sup>10</sup> I have also acquired Ruth the Moabitess, Mahlon’s widow, as my wife, to perpetuate the deceased man’s name on his property, so that his name will not disappear among his relatives or from the gate of his hometown. You are witnesses today.”

## The First Redeemer: The Closer Kinsmen

### God Does: God accomplishes his purposes

><sup>1-2</sup> Boaz went to the gate of the town and sat down there. Soon the family redeemer Boaz had spoken about came by. Boaz said, “Come over here and sit down.” So he went over and sat down. Then Boaz took ten men of the town’s elders and said, “Sit here.” And they sat down.

- The Covenant of Redemption to the cross of Christ
- No means is can it be reduced to like a business matter or a legal transaction
- But make no mistake: God took action, step-by-step, in the background, foreground and through mankind, in order to accomplish his purposes

### God Does: God wants to not because it was the easiest path

><sup>3-4</sup> He said to the redeemer, “Naomi, who has returned from the territory of Moab, is selling the portion of the field that belonged to our brother Elimelech. I thought I should inform you: Buy it back in the presence of those seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you want to redeem it, do it. But if you do not want to redeem it, tell me so that I will know, because there isn’t anyone other than you to redeem it, and I am next after you.” “I want to redeem it,” he answered.

- not necessarily the bad guy
- shrewd, wise
- considered the cost 
- safe bet
- the deal on paper made total sense
- determining the will of God especially when it comes to ministering to others
  - Read the Scriptures
  - seek godly counsel
  - exercise wisdom and prudence
  - Reading of missionaries and biographies of Christians who have gone before us: so risky so bold so dangerous--but Christians before us read the Scriptures, sought counsel, exercised wisdom and prudence, counted the cost, and then went out and did it

### God Does: God wants to do what is necessary because he loves us

><sup>5-6</sup> Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the field from Naomi, you will acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the deceased man, to perpetuate the man’s name on his property.” The redeemer replied, “I can’t redeem it myself, or I will ruin my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption, because I can’t redeem it.”

- redeemer marries widow
- yet their son will inherit his deceased dad's property

>Deuteronomy 25:5-6 (CSB) When brothers live on the same property and one of them dies without a son, the wife of the dead man may not marry a stranger outside the family. Her brother-in-law is to take her as his wife, have sexual relations with her, and perform the duty of a brother-in-law for her. The first son she bears will carry on the name of the dead brother, so his name will not be blotted out from Israel.

## The Second Redeemer: Boaz, Part 1

### God Does: Legally saves us

><sup>7-9</sup> At an earlier period in Israel, a man removed his sandal and gave it to the other party in order to make any matter legally binding concerning the right of redemption or the exchange of property. This was the method of legally binding a transaction in Israel. So the redeemer removed his sandal and said to Boaz, “Buy back the property yourself.” Boaz said to the elders and all the people, “You are witnesses today that I am buying from Naomi everything that belonged to Elimelech, Chilion, and Mahlon.

Again, not to reduce the work of God down to a business or legal matter but the analogies do work.

>1 Corinthians 6:19-20 (CSB) Don’t you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were bought at a price. So glorify God with your body.

>Colossians 2:14 (CSB) He erased the certificate of debt, with its obligations, that was against us and opposed to us, and has taken it away by nailing it to the cross.

>1 Peter 1:18-19 (CSB) For you know that you were redeemed from your empty way of life inherited from your fathers, not with perishable things like silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of an unblemished and spotless lamb.

We have been redeemed and justified by Christ. Because of our sins, we needed to be saved and only Christ, our Kinsmen Redeemer could do it, was willing to do it, had the power to do it and actually did it.

We often use the analogy of redemption and justification in legal terms. We do so because of our sake, there was a trial.

>Matthew 27:20-22 (CSB) The chief priests and the elders, however, persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to execute Jesus. The governor asked them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you? ”  
>“Barabbas! ” they answered.  
>Pilate asked them, “What should I do then with Jesus, who is  called Christ? ”  
>They all answered, “Crucify him! ”

Barabbas is us and Christ is Christ!

### God Does: God will never forget us nor forsake us

><sup>10</sup> I have also acquired Ruth the Moabitess, Mahlon’s widow, as my wife, to perpetuate the deceased man’s name on his property, so that his name will not disappear among his relatives or from the gate of his hometown. You are witnesses today.”

- this was so that the name of the dead would not be forgotten nor blotted out
- The grace of God in his law
- The law of God is good and holy and righteous
- The law of God does not save us
- The law of God is a reflection of the character of God
- The law represents our condemnation, his holiness, and his grace
- Boaz: obeyed the law of God so that Mahlon's name would not be blotted out from existence
- The gospel of God so that our names are in the book of life

>Luke 10:20 (CSB) However, don’t rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.”
