# Mark 2:18-22 Jesus is the Bridegroom

## The Text

>Mark 2:18-22 (CSB) Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. People came and asked him, “Why do John’s disciples and the Pharisees’ disciples fast, but your disciples do not fast?”
>
>19 Jesus said to them, “The wedding guests cannot fast while the groom is with them, can they? As long as they have the groom with them, they cannot fast. But the time will come when the groom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast on that day. No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Otherwise, the new patch pulls away from the old cloth, and a worse tear is made. And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost as well as the skins. No, new wine is put into fresh wineskins.”

## The Devotion

>Revelation 19:6-9 (CSB) Then I heard something like the voice of a vast multitude, like the sound of cascading waters, and like the rumbling of loud thunder, saying,  
>Hallelujah, because our Lord God, the Almighty, reigns!  
>7 Let us be glad, rejoice, and give him glory,  
>because the marriage of the Lamb has come,  
>and his bride has prepared herself.  
>8 She was given fine linen to wear, bright and pure.  
>For the fine linen represents the righteous acts of the saints.  
>9 Then he said to me, “Write: Blessed are those invited to the marriage feast of the Lamb!” He also said to me, “These words of God are true.”
