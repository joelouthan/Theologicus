# Mark 13:1-2 What Does Christ Want? Our Sin

## The Text

>Mark 13:1–2 (CSB)  
><sup> 1 </sup> As he was going out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, “Teacher, look! What massive stones! What impressive buildings!” 
>
><sup> 2 </sup> Jesus said to him, “Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left upon another—all will be thrown down.”

## The Devotion

>Luke 23:28-31 (CSB) But turning to them, Jesus said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and your children. Look, the days are coming when they will say, ‘Blessed are the women without children, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed! ’ Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us! ’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us! ’ For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry? ”

>Hosea 10:8 (CSB) The high places of Aven, the sin of Israel,
will be destroyed;
thorns and thistles will grow over their altars.
They will say to the mountains, “Cover us! ”
and to the hills, “Fall on us! ”

>Revelation 6:15-17 (CSB) Then the kings of the earth, the nobles, the generals, the rich, the powerful, and every slave and free person hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains. And they said to the mountains and to the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of the one seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb, because the great day of their wrath has come! And who is able to stand? ”

>John 3:36 (CSB) The one who believes in the Son has eternal life, but the one who rejects the Son will not see life; instead, the wrath of God remains on him.

The Lord Jesus Christ has commanded each of us to repent of our sin.

Where shall our sin go?

Only to God.

>Psalms 103:12-13 (CSB) As far as the east is from the west,
so far has he removed
our transgressions from us.
As a father has compassion on his children,
so the LORD has compassion on those who fear him.

How does he take our sin?

By placing our sin on his Son.

Nothing in this world in this life matters if you do not repent and believe Jesus Christ.

His kingdom is now.
