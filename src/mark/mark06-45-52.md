# Mark 6:45-52 Jesus is the Lord over Sin

## The Text

>Mark 6:45–52 (CSB)  
><sup> 45 </sup> Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd. 
>
><sup> 46 </sup> After he said good-bye to them, he went away to the mountain to pray. 
>
><sup> 47 </sup> Well into the night, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and he was alone on the land. 
>
><sup> 48 </sup> He saw them straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. Very early in the morning he came toward them walking on the sea and wanted to pass by them. 
>
><sup> 49 </sup> When they saw him walking on the sea, they thought it was a ghost and cried out, 
>
><sup> 50 </sup> because they all saw him and were terrified. Immediately he spoke with them and said, “Have courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.” 
>
><sup> 51 </sup> Then he got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. They were completely astounded, 
>
><sup> 52 </sup> because they had not understood about the loaves. Instead, their hearts were hardened.

## The Devotion

### Christ rightfully judges our sin

>Genesis 7:20-23 (CSB) The mountains were covered as the water surged above them more than twenty feet. Every creature perished—those that crawl on the earth, birds, livestock, wildlife, and those that swarm on the earth, as well as all mankind. Everything with the breath of the spirit of life in its nostrils—everything on dry land died. He wiped out every living thing that was on the face of the earth, from mankind to livestock, to creatures that crawl, to the birds of the sky, and they were wiped off the earth. Only Noah was left, and those that were with him in the ark.

>Psalm 36:6 (CSB) our righteousness is like the highest mountains,
your judgments like the deepest sea.
LORD, you preserve people and animals.

>Psalm 78:53 (CSB) He led them safely, and they were not afraid;
but the sea covered their enemies.

### Christ mercifully saves us from sin

>Genesis 7:1 (CSB) Then the LORD said to Noah, “Enter the ark, you and all your household, for I have seen that you alone are righteous before me in this generation.

### Christ saves us to himself

><sup> 49 </sup> When they saw him walking on the sea, they thought it was a ghost and cried out, 
>
><sup> 50 </sup> because they all saw him and were terrified. Immediately he spoke with them and said, “Have courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.” 
>
><sup> 51 </sup> Then he got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. They were completely astounded, 
>
><sup> 52 </sup> because they had not understood about the loaves. Instead, their hearts were hardened.
