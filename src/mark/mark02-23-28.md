# Mark 2:23-28 Jesus is Our Rest

## The Text

>Mark 2:23-28 (CSB) On the Sabbath he was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to make their way, picking some heads of grain.The Pharisees said to him, “Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?”
>
>25 He said to them, “Have you never read what David and those who were with him did when he was in need and hungry —how he entered the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest and ate the bread of the Presence —which is not lawful for anyone to eat except the priests —and also gave some to his companions?”Then he told them, “The Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath.So then, the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”

## The Devotion

Jesus gave us rest because He knew we needed rest and resting (naps, sleep, fun) are awesome.  More than being awesome, our body, mind, and spirit needs to chill out everyone once in a while. Not all the time—but some of the time. Jesus gave Himself to us so that we wouldn't work so hard to be saved. Jesus did all of the hard work so that you can be saved to Him forever.

But more than for our physical, mental, and emotional, God provides rest for our spiritual selves. Let us see how this play out.
