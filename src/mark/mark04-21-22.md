# Mark 4:21-22 Jesus is the Light

## The Text

>Mark 4:21–22 (CSB)  
><sup> 21 </sup> He also said to them, “Is a lamp brought in to be put under a basket or under a bed? Isn’t it to be put on a lampstand? 
>
><sup> 22 </sup> For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing concealed that will not be brought to light.

## The Devotion

If we believe, trust, hope, and obey in Jesus Christ our Lord, do we keep it a secret or do we live this new life that we have received by God?
