# Mark 4:23-25 Jesus Gives More, Do We Receive?

## The Text
>Mark 4:23–25 (CSB)  
> 23  If anyone has ears to hear, let him listen.” 

> 24  And he said to them, “Pay attention to what you hear. By the measure you use, it will be measured to you—and more will be added to you. 

> 25  For whoever has, more will be given to him, and whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.”

## The Devotion

When we go to God, what are we asking for?
