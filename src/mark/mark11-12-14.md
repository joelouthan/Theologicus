## The Devotion

Here are big facts: we are born to die.

And in our sin, we are judged according and will die in our sins.

But here's the gospel, from the moment sin came into the world and into our lives and into our hearts, God stepped into our lives and gave this promise:

>Genesis 3:15 (CSB) I will put hostility between you and the woman,
and between your offspring and her offspring.
He will strike your head,
and you will strike his heel.

Here's the thing: without God dwelling in us, we cannot believe that God was going to be good on that promise and anything else that comes out his mouth. That is sin: we cannot believe God because of the infection of sin on our hearts.

Your heart is incapable and not good enough to believe in God.

God knows that. He preached that word knowing full well we can't fulfill it. God saw our brokenness and weakness and sin.

God preached it. God promised it. God gives everything we need in order to do his will.

Our heart was wicked. God gives his heart.

We are dead in our trespasses. God gives us His Spirit so we can be born again.

We so far and lost in God. God sent us His Son to live and die and to bridge that gap so we can be with Him, dwell in his presence with maxed out joy and pleasures forevermore.

This is our God. Those who do not obey the Son of God will fall under the wrath of God. Those who believe and trust in Christ will be with God forever.

Choose on this day on whom you will serve. Choose whether you will live or die.
