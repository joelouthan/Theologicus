## The Introduction

>Mark 4:10–13 (CSB)  
><sup> 10 </sup> When he was alone, those around him with the Twelve asked him about the parables. 
>
><sup> 11 </sup> He answered them, “The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to those outside, everything comes in parables 
>
><sup> 12 </sup> so that they may indeed look, and yet not perceive; they may indeed listen, and yet not understand; otherwise, they might turn back and be forgiven.” 
>
><sup> 13 </sup> Then he said to them, “Don’t you understand this parable? How then will you understand all of the parables?
