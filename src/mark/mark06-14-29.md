# Mark 6:14-29 Jesus is the Lord over Humanity

## The Text

>Mark 6:14–29  
><sup> 14 </sup> King Herod heard about it, because Jesus’s name had become well known. Some said, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that’s why miraculous powers are at work in him.” 
>
><sup> 15 </sup> But others said, “He’s Elijah.” Still others said, “He’s a prophet, like one of the prophets from long ago.” 
>
><sup> 16 </sup> When Herod heard of it, he said, “John, the one I beheaded, has been raised!” 
>
><sup> 17 </sup> For Herod himself had given orders to arrest John and to chain him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, because he had married her. 
>
><sup> 18 </sup> John had been telling Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.” 
>
><sup> 19 </sup> So Herodias held a grudge against him and wanted to kill him. But she could not, 
>
><sup> 20 </sup> because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing he was a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard him he would be very perplexed, and yet he liked to listen to him. 
>
><sup> 21 </sup> An opportune time came on his birthday, when Herod gave a banquet for his nobles, military commanders, and the leading men of Galilee. 
>
><sup> 22 </sup> When Herodias’s own daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. The king said to the girl, “Ask me whatever you want, and I’ll give it to you.” 
>
><sup> 23 </sup> He promised her with an oath: “Whatever you ask me I will give you, up to half my kingdom.” 
>
><sup> 24 </sup> She went out and said to her mother, “What should I ask for?” “John the Baptist’s head,” she said. 
>
><sup> 25 </sup> At once she hurried to the king and said, “I want you to give me John the Baptist’s head on a platter immediately.” 
>
><sup> 26 </sup> Although the king was deeply distressed, because of his oaths and the guests he did not want to refuse her. 
>
><sup> 27 </sup> The king immediately sent for an executioner and commanded him to bring John’s head. So he went and beheaded him in prison, 
>
><sup> 28 </sup> brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl. Then the girl gave it to her mother. 
>
><sup> 29 </sup> When John’s disciples heard about it, they came and removed his corpse and placed it in a tomb.

## The Devotion

### Christ is creator of all life

>John 1:1-5 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. All things were created through him, and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created. In him was life, and that life was the light of men. That light shines in the darkness, and yet the darkness did not overcome it.

### Christ is the source of of life

>Colossians 1:15-20 He is the image of the invisible God,
the firstborn over all creation.
16 For everything was created by him,
in heaven and on earth,
the visible and the invisible,
whether thrones or dominions
or rulers or authorities—
all things have been created through him and for him.
17 He is before all things,
and by him all things hold together.
18 He is also the head of the body, the church;
he is the beginning,
the firstborn from the dead,
so that he might come to have
first place in everything.
19 For God was pleased to have
all his fullness dwell in him,
20 and through him to reconcile
everything to himself,
whether things on earth or things in heaven,
by making peace
through his blood, shed on the cross.

### Christ has appointed when and where we live

>Acts 17:24-28 The God who made the world and everything in it—he is Lord of heaven and earth—does not live in shrines made by hands. Neither is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives everyone life and breath and all things. From one man he has made every nationality to live over the whole earth and has determined their appointed times and the boundaries of where they live. He did this so that they might seek God, and perhaps they might reach out and find him, though he is not far from each one of us. For in him we live and move and have our being, as even some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also his offspring.’

### Christ has appointed the number of our days

>Psalm 139:16 Your eyes saw me when I was formless;
all my days were written in your book and planned
before a single one of them began.

>Hebrews 9:27-28 And just as it is appointed for people to die once—and after this, judgment— so also Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.

### Christ knows when we will pass away

>Matthew 11:1-6 When Jesus had finished giving instructions to his twelve disciples, he moved on from there to teach and preach in their towns. Now when John heard in prison what the Christ was doing, he sent a message through his disciples and asked him, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?”
>
>4 Jesus replied to them, “Go and report to John what you hear and see: The blind receive their sight, the lame walk, those with leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor are told the good news, and blessed is the one who isn’t offended by me.”

>Isaiah 35:5 Then the eyes of the blind will be opened,
and the ears of the deaf unstopped.

>Isaiah 61:1 The Spirit of the Lord GOD is on me,
because the LORD has anointed me
to bring good news to the poor.
He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted,
to proclaim liberty to the captives
and freedom to the prisoners;
