## The Devotion

We know that Christ is the Lord over Humanity and in Acts 17 declares that he determines the times of our dwelling.

But it goes beyond that.

### Christ created the heavens and the earth

>John 1:1-2 (CSB) In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning.

### Christ is before the creation of the earth

>Psalm 90:1-2 (CSB) Lord, you have been our refuge
in every generation.
2 Before the mountains were born,
before you gave birth to the earth and the world,
from eternity to eternity, you are God.

### Christ is forever past and forever future

>Revelation 1:8 (CSB) “I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “the one who is, who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.”

>Revelation 21:5-8 (CSB) Then the one seated on the throne said, “Look, I am making everything new.” He also said, “Write, because these words are faithful and true.” Then he said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will freely give to the thirsty from the spring of the water of life. The one who conquers will inherit these things, and I will be his God, and he will be my son. But the cowards, faithless, detestable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars—their share will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”

>Revelation 22:12-13 (CSB) “Look, I am coming soon, and my reward is with me to repay each person according to his work. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.

### Yet, Christ is here in you

>Revelation 3:19-20 (CSB) As many as I love, I rebuke and discipline. So be zealous and repent. See! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me.
