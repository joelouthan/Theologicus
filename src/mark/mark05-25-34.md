# Mark 5:25-34	Jesus is the Lord of Power

## The Text

><sup> 25 </sup> Now a woman suffering from bleeding for twelve years 
>
><sup> 26 </sup> had endured much under many doctors. She had spent everything she had and was not helped at all. On the contrary, she became worse. 
>
><sup> 27 </sup> Having heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his clothing. 
>
><sup> 28 </sup> For she said, “If I just touch his clothes, I’ll be made well.” 
>
><sup> 29 </sup> Instantly her flow of blood ceased, and she sensed in her body that she was healed of her affliction. 
>
><sup> 30 </sup> Immediately Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and said, “Who touched my clothes?” 
>
><sup> 31 </sup> His disciples said to him, “You see the crowd pressing against you, and yet you say, ‘Who touched me?’ ” 
>
><sup> 32 </sup> But he was looking around to see who had done this. 
>
><sup> 33 </sup> The woman, with fear and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before him, and told him the whole truth. 
>
><sup> 34 </sup> “Daughter,” he said to her, “your faith has saved you. Go in peace and be healed from your affliction.” 

## The Devotion

### The power to create all of creation

>Genesis 1:1 (CSB) In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

>John 1:3 (CSB) All things were created through him, and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created.

### The power to create light

>Genesis 1:3-4 (CSB) Then God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness.

### The power to create life

>Genesis 1:26-27 (CSB) Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness. They will rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the livestock, the whole earth, and the creatures that crawl on the earth.”
27 So God created man
in his own image;
he created him in the image of God;
he created them male and female.

>Psalms 139:13-14 (CSB) or it was you who created my inward parts;
you knit me together in my mother’s womb.
14 I will praise you
because I have been remarkably and wondrously made.
Your works are wondrous,
and I know this very well.

### The power to create new creation

>2 Corinthians 5:17 (CSB) Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has passed away, and see, the new has come!

### The power to create a new heart

>Ezekiel 36:26 (CSB) I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will remove your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.

### The power to create new life

>John 1:4-5 (CSB) In him was life, and that life was the light of men. That light shines in the darkness, and yet the darkness did not overcome it.

>1 John 5:1 (CSB) Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father also loves the one born of him.

>John 3:5-8 (CSB) Jesus answered, “Truly I tell you, unless someone is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. Whatever is born of the flesh is flesh, and whatever is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not be amazed that I told you that you must be born again. The wind blows where it pleases, and you hear its sound, but you don’t know where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.”
