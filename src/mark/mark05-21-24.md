## The Text

><sup> 22 </sup> One of the synagogue leaders, named Jairus, came, and when he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet 
>
><sup> 23 </sup> and begged him earnestly, “My little daughter is dying. Come and lay your hands on her so that she can get well and live.”

## The Devotion

### Let your prayers be direct

>Matthew 6:5-8 (CSB) “Whenever you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites, because they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by people. Truly I tell you, they have their reward. But when you pray, go into your private room, shut your door, and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you. When you pray, don’t babble like the Gentiles, since they imagine they’ll be heard for their many words. Don’t be like them, because your Father knows the things you need before you ask him.

### Let your prayers be out of your needs

>James 5:13-18 (CSB)Is anyone among you suffering? He should pray. Is anyone cheerful? He should sing praises. Is anyone among you sick? He should call for the elders of the church, and they are to pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. The prayer of faith will save the sick person, and the Lord will raise him up; if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven. Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is very powerful in its effect. Elijah was a human being as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and for three years and six months it did not rain on the land. Then he prayed again, and the sky gave rain and the land produced its fruit.

### Let your prayers be for everyone

>1 Timothy 2:1-4 (CSB) First of all, then, I urge that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for everyone,for kings and all those who are in authority, so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity. This is good, and it pleases God our Savior,who wants everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.

### Let your prayers be in the Spirit

>Ephesians 6:18 (CSB) Pray at all times in the Spirit with every prayer and request, and stay alert with all perseverance and intercession for all the saints.

### Let your prayers be constant

>1 Thessalonians 5:15-22 (CSB) See to it that no one repays evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue what is good for one another and for all. Rejoice always,pray constantly,give thanks in everything; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus. Don’t stifle the Spirit. Don’t despise prophecies,but test all things. Hold on to what is good. Stay away from every kind of evil.
