## The Devotion

Christ is the only way to God.

It is as simple as that.

### Christ is the only way: for anybody who died before the death of Christ

>Romans 3:21-26 (CSB) But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed, attested by the Law and the Prophets. The righteousness of God is through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe, since there is no distinction. For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God; they are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. God presented him as the mercy seat by his blood, through faith, to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his restraint God passed over the sins previously committed. God presented him to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so that he would be just and justify the one who has faith in Jesus.

>John 8:54–58 (CSB)  
><sup>54</sup> “If I glorify myself,” Jesus answered, “my glory is nothing. My Father—about whom you say, ‘He is our God’—he is the one who glorifies me. 
>
><sup>55</sup> You do not know him, but I know him. If I were to say I don’t know him, I would be a liar like you. But I do know him, and I keep his word. 
>
><sup>56</sup> Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; he saw it and was glad.” 
>
><sup>57</sup> The Jews replied, “You aren’t fifty years old yet, and you’ve seen Abraham?” 
>
><sup>58</sup> Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, before Abraham was, I am.”

>Luke 23:39–43 (CSB)  
><sup>39</sup> Then one of the criminals hanging there began to yell insults at him: “Aren’t you the Messiah? Save yourself and us!” 
>
><sup>40</sup> But the other answered, rebuking him: “Don’t you even fear God, since you are undergoing the same punishment? 
>
><sup>41</sup> We are punished justly, because we’re getting back what we deserve for the things we did, but this man has done nothing wrong.” 
>
><sup>42</sup> Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.” 
>
><sup>43</sup> And he said to him, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise.”

### Christ is the only way: for everyone since the death of Christ

>John 20:16–17 (CSB)  
><sup>16</sup> Jesus said to her, “Mary.” Turning around, she said to him in Aramaic, “Rabboni!”—which means “Teacher.” 
>
><sup>17</sup> “Don’t cling to me,” Jesus told her, “since I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and tell them that I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.”

### Christ is the only way, the truth and the life

>John 14:1–7 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> “Don’t let your heart be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me. 
>
><sup>2</sup> In my Father’s house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you? 
>
><sup>3</sup> If I go away and prepare a place for you, I will come again and take you to myself, so that where I am you may be also. 
>
><sup>4</sup> You know the way to where I am going.” 
>
><sup>5</sup> “Lord,” Thomas said, “we don’t know where you’re going. How can we know the way?” 
>
><sup>6</sup> Jesus told him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. 
>
><sup>7</sup> If you know me, you will also know my Father. From now on you do know him and have seen him.”

### Christ is the only way that we can be saved

>Romans 10:13 (CSB) For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.

Oh there are tons of ways to get to God. Only one way to protect us from the wrath of God that is to come: that is through Jesus Christ his Son.

>Matthew 23:37-39 (CSB) “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her. How often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing! See, your house is left to you desolate. For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord’!”
