# Mark 12:38-40 So That We Might Live and Be In His Family Forever

## The Text

><sup> 38 </sup> He also said in his teaching, “Beware of the scribes, who want to go around in long robes and who want greetings in the marketplaces, 
>
><sup> 39 </sup> the best seats in the synagogues, and the places of honor at banquets. 
>
><sup> 40 </sup> They devour widows’ houses and say long prayers just for show. These will receive harsher judgment.” 

## The Devotion

Power, prestige, greed, status, wealth, promotion, gain--none of that matters in the kingdom of God.

Why strive for power when our great Triune God is the Almighty God, infinite in power and might!

>Revelation 1:8 (CSB) I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “the one who is, who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.”

>Revelation 4:8 (CSB) Each of the four living creatures had six wings; they were covered with eyes around and inside. Day and night they never stop, saying,
Holy, holy, holy,
Lord God, the Almighty,
who was, who is, and who is to come.

>2 Corinthians 6:16-18 (CSB) And what agreement does the temple of God have with idols? For we are the temple of the living God, as God said:
I will dwell
and walk among them,
and I will be their God,
and they will be my people.
Therefore, come out from among them
and be separate, says the Lord;
do not touch any unclean thing,
and I will welcome you.
And I will be a Father to you,
and you will be sons and daughters to me,
says the Lord Almighty.

What is greed and wealth when my Lord:

>Psalms 50:9-11 (CSB) I will not take a bull from your household
or male goats from your pens,
for every animal of the forest is mine,
the cattle on a thousand hills.
I know every bird of the mountains,
and the creatures of the field are mine.

>1 Chronicles 29:11-12 (CSB) Yours, LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the splendor and the majesty, for everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to you. Yours, LORD, is the kingdom, and you are exalted as head over all. Riches and honor come from you, and you are the ruler of everything. Power and might are in your hand, and it is in your hand to make great and to give strength to all.

Promotion? We are the sons and daughters of the only good Father and our brother is the King of kings who has inherited everything and we have co-inherited everything with him:

>Hebrews 1:2 (CSB) In these last days, he has spoken to us by his Son. God has appointed him heir of all things and made the universe through him.

>Daniel 7:13-14 (CSB) I continued watching in the night visions,  
>and suddenly one like a son of man  
>was coming with the clouds of heaven.  
>He approached the Ancient of Days  
>and was escorted before him.  
>He was given dominion  
>and glory and a kingdom,  
>so that those of every people,  
>nation, and language  
>should serve him.  
>His dominion is an everlasting dominion  
>that will not pass away,  
>and his kingdom is one  
>that will not be destroyed.

>Romans 8:14-17 (CSB) For all those led by God’s Spirit are God’s sons. For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear. Instead, you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father!” The Spirit himself testifies together with our spirit that we are God’s children, and if children, also heirs—heirs of God and coheirs with Christ—if indeed we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.

Gain? In this life? In this world? That is for natural, broken, sin-infected world. The more I gain here, the more I will lose my soul.

>Mark 8:36-37 (CSB) For what does it benefit someone to gain the whole world and yet lose his life? What can anyone give in exchange for his life?

You want to gain in the kingdom of God? You will have to die.

>Matthew 16:24-25 (CSB) Then Jesus said to his disciples, “If anyone wants to follow after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life because of me will find it.

>Philippians 1:20-21 (CSB) My eager expectation and hope is that I will not be ashamed about anything, but that now as always, with all courage, Christ will be highly honored in my body, whether by life or by death. For me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.

Power, gain, honor, wealth is not our end goal. They will not satisfy our hearts.

We will not be satisfied until we can hold our Savior's face.

>Psalms 17:14-15 (CSB) With your hand, LORD, save me from men,
from men of the world
whose portion is in this life:
You fill their bellies with what you have in store;
their sons are satisfied,
and they leave their surplus to their children.
But I will see your face in righteousness;
when I awake, I will be satisfied with your presence.
