# Mark 11:27-33 So That We Might Live and Know Him

## The Text

>Mark 11:27–33 (CSB)  
><sup> 27 </sup> They came again to Jerusalem. As he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders came 
>
><sup> 28 </sup> and asked him, “By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority to do these things?” 
>
><sup> 29 </sup> Jesus said to them, “I will ask you one question; then answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. 
>
><sup> 30 </sup> Was John’s baptism from heaven or of human origin? Answer me.” 
>
><sup> 31 </sup> They discussed it among themselves: “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’ 
>
><sup> 32 </sup> But if we say, ‘Of human origin’”—they were afraid of the crowd, because everyone thought that John was truly a prophet. 
>
><sup> 33 </sup> So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.” And Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”

## The Devotion

The salvation of God is not a pop quiz that awaits you when you get to the kingdom of God.

It is not what you know. All the books, seminary, private Christian school, homeschool, mom, dad, pastor, church, denomination, theology, right Bible tranlation, verse memorization--none of that will matter before Christ himself.

Salvation is: Do you know God because God dwells in you? Do you love God because God gave you his heart and Spirit so that you can love Him? Have you given your sin over to the Christ because God has granted you repentance?

We don't treat relationships like this--do we? This is not a sitcom where the wife accuses the husband of being dumb and the husband scrambles for an answer so that he doesn't get in trouble. What if your kids do that--instead of telling the truth, they scramble for a lie so that they avoid punishment.

Here's the upside-down-ness of the kingdom of God.

If you try to lie to the only God who knows the deepest, darkest parts of your heart, you will be punished for all of eternity.

If you come with truth--I am a sinner in desperate need of your grace. Guess what God does? He gives you every blessing starting with his Son and the inheritance of the world.

Stop looking for right answer to avoid punishment. Believe and trust in Christ so that you will be saved.
