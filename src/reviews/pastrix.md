# Pastrix: The Cranky, Beautiful Faith of a Sinner & Saint by Nadia Bolz-Weber

## The Review

Let me sum up the book in one quote:

>What passes for preaching in many cases is more ‘here’s the problem, and here’s what you can do about it.’ That good news really should be about who God is and how God works and what God has done and what God will do.

## The Afterthought

*Why did I include this review? I used to say that [Ortlund's Gentle & Lowly](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52891090-gentle-and-lowly) was a book that God used to pushed me all the way into Reformed theology. But reading my reviews, I think it was this book that God used to point my feet and help me land all the way into Reformed theology and not just keep one foot into Evangelicalism with a veneer of Calvinism layered on for good measure. Praise be to God! -Ed.*
