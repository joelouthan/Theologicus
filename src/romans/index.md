# Romans

## The Introduction

In 2010, I came across a gem of a book called [No Condemnation in Christ Jesus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4011534-no-condemnation-in-christ-jesus) by Octavius Winslow, a contemporary of Charles Spurgeon, from 19th century England.

And I wrote a [little review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/134527292).

And writing that review sparked a writing flame that has consumed my heart ever since. That review turned into my own attempt to writing my own expository commentary on Romans 8, which ended up being a 50,000 word treatise.

And from that treatise, comes this blog turned a series of books I like to call [Theologicus](https://theologic.us).

And if I am going to write about the 8th chapter of Romans, why not Romans. And if Romans, why not the entire Bible. If if the Bible, why not the historical creeds and confessions.

All Theologicus is my attempt to show you that Jesus loves you this I know for the Bible tells me so. And this is my humble attempt to tell him how much I love him so.

What do I do with this? Growing up Evangelical megachurch and in the era of the social media influencer, I assume I had to chase down publishing deals and turn these into books.

But you know what? I see guys my own age and younger who have upteen years more experience in ministry, teaching and preaching and putting out books. And to be honest, those are not really the books I keep coming back.

I keep going back to the books written by the really old. The ones who have seen all of life and seen God and put those things together. That is the kind of books I want to write. I want to write the kind of books that I want to read. And I want to write the kind of books that have seen life and God and put that together. I want to see more of the loveliness of Christ and express that to you so that your joy may be full.

And at the moment, Theologicus is not it. Like Calvin's Institutes, it will always be a work in progress as long as Christ keeps me here.
