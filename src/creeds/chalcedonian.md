# The Chalcedonian Creed

>We, then, following the holy fathers,  
>all with one consent teach men to confess one and the same Son,  
>our Lord Jesus Christ,  
>the same perfect in Godhead  
>and also perfect in manhood;  
>truly God and truly man,  
>of a rational soul and body;  
>coessential with the Father according to the Godhead,  
>and consubstantial with us according to the manhood;  
>in all things like unto us,  
>without sin;  
>begotten before all ages of the Father according to the Godhead,  
>and in these latter days,  
>for us and for our salvation,  
>born of the Virgin Mary, the mother of God, according to the manhood;  
>one and the same Christ, Son, Lord,
>Only-begotten,  
>to be acknowledged in two natures,  
>without confusion,  
>without change,  
>without division,  
>without separation;  
>the distinction of natures being by no means taken away by the union,  
>but rather the property of each nature being preserved,  
>and concurring in one person and one subsistence,  
>not parted or divided into two persons,  
>but one and the same Son,  
>and only begotten,  
>God the Word,  
>the Lord Jesus Christ;  
>as the prophets from the beginning have declared concerning Him,  
>and the Lord Jesus Christ Himself has taught us,  
>and the creed of the holy fathers has handed down to us.
