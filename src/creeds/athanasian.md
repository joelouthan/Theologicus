# The Athanasian Creed

>Whoever desires to be saved should above all hold to the catholic faith.  
>
>Anyone who does not keep it whole and unbroken will doubtless perish eternally.  
>
>Now this is the catholic faith:  
>
>That we worship one God in trinity and the trinity in unity,  
>neither blending their persons  
>nor dividing their essence.  
>For the person of the Father is a distinct person,  
>the person of the Son is another,  
>and that of the Holy Spirit still another.  
>But the divinity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is one,  
>their glory equal, their majesty coeternal.  
>
>What quality the Father has, the Son has, and the Holy Spirit has.  
>The Father is uncreated,  
>the Son is uncreated,  
>the Holy Spirit is uncreated.  
>
>The Father is immeasurable,  
>the Son is immeasurable,  
>the Holy Spirit is immeasurable.  
>
>The Father is eternal,  
>the Son is eternal,  
>the Holy Spirit is eternal.  
>
>And yet there are not three eternal beings;  
>there is but one eternal being.  
>So too there are not three uncreated or immeasurable beings;  
>there is but one uncreated and immeasurable being.  
>
>Similarly, the Father is almighty,  
>the Son is almighty,  
>the Holy Spirit is almighty.  
>Yet there are not three almighty beings;  
>there is but one almighty being.  
>
>Thus the Father is God,  
>the Son is God,  
>the Holy Spirit is God.  
>Yet there are not three gods;  
>there is but one God.  
>
>Thus the Father is Lord,  
>the Son is Lord,  
>the Holy Spirit is Lord.  
>Yet there are not three lords;  
>there is but one Lord.  
>
>Just as Christian truth compels us  
>to confess each person individually  
>as both God and Lord,  
>so catholic religion forbids us  
>to say that there are three gods or lords.  
>
>The Father was neither made nor created nor begotten from anyone.  
>The Son was neither made nor created;  
>he was begotten from the Father alone.  
>The Holy Spirit was neither made nor created nor begotten;  
>he proceeds from the Father and the Son.  
>
>Accordingly there is one Father, not three fathers;  
>there is one Son, not three sons;  
>there is one Holy Spirit, not three holy spirits.  
>
>Nothing in this trinity is before or after,  
>nothing is greater or smaller;  
>in their entirety the three persons  
>are coeternal and coequal with each other.  
>
>So in everything, as was said earlier,  
>we must worship their trinity in their unity  
>and their unity in their trinity.  
>
>Anyone then who desires to be saved  
>should think thus about the trinity.  
>
>But it is necessary for eternal salvation  
>that one also believe in the incarnation  
>of our Lord Jesus Christ faithfully.  
>
>Now this is the true faith:  
>
>That we believe and confess  
>that our Lord Jesus Christ, God's Son,  
>is both God and human, equally.  
>
>He is God from the essence of the Father,  
>begotten before time;  
>and he is human from the essence of his mother,  
>born in time;  
>completely God, completely human,  
>with a rational soul and human flesh;  
>equal to the Father as regards divinity,  
>less than the Father as regards humanity.  
>
>Although he is God and human,  
>yet Christ is not two, but one.  
>He is one, however,  
>not by his divinity being turned into flesh,  
>but by God's taking humanity to himself.  
>He is one,  
>certainly not by the blending of his essence,  
>but by the unity of his person.  
>For just as one human is both rational soul and flesh,  
>so too the one Christ is both God and human.  
>
>He suffered for our salvation;  
>he descended to hell;  
>he arose from the dead;  
>he ascended to heaven;  
>he is seated at the Father's right hand;  
>from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.  
>At his coming all people will arise bodily  
>and give an accounting of their own deeds.  
>Those who have done good will enter eternal life,  
>and those who have done evil will enter eternal fire.  
>
>This is the catholic faith:  
>one cannot be saved without believing it firmly and faithfully.
