# 18.3 Let Me All Thy Love Accepting: The Spirit is Given Freely to Us in Christ

## The Text

>John 3:31-36 (CSB) The one who comes from above is above all. The one who is from the earth is earthly and speaks in earthly terms. The one who comes from heaven is above all. He testifies to what he has seen and heard, and yet no one accepts his testimony. The one who has accepted his testimony has affirmed that God is true. For the one whom God sent speaks God’s words, since he gives the Spirit without measure. The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hands. The one who believes in the Son has eternal life, but the one who rejects the Son will not see life; instead, the wrath of God remains on him.

## The Chapter

### This infallible assurance doth not so belong to the essence of faith, but that a true believer may wait long, and conflict with many difficulties before he be partaker of it; yet being enabled by the Spirit to know the things which are freely given him of God, he may, without extraordinary revelation, in the right use of means, attain thereunto: and therefore it is the duty of every one to give all diligence to make his calling and election sure, that thereby his heart may be enlarged in peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, in love and thankfulness to God, and in strength and cheerfulness in the duties of obedience, the proper fruits of this assurance; -so far is it from inclining men to looseness.

## The Confession

### Let Me All Thy Love Accepting: This infallible assurance does not so belong to the essence of faith, but that a true believer may wait long, and struggle with many difficulties before he be partaker of it

>Isaiah 50:10 (CSB) Who among you fears the LORD and listens to his servant? Who among you walks in darkness, and has no light? Let him trust in the name of the LORD; let him lean on his God.

>Psalm 88 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A song. A psalm of the sons of Korah. For the choir director: according to Mahalath Leannoth. A Maskil of Heman the Ezrahite.

><sup>1</sup> LORD, God of my salvation, I cry out before you day and night. 
>
><sup>2</sup> May my prayer reach your presence; listen to my cry. 
>
><sup>3</sup> For I have had enough troubles, and my life is near Sheol. 
>
><sup>4</sup> I am counted among those going down to the Pit. I am like a man without strength, 
>
><sup>5</sup> abandoned among the dead. I am like the slain lying in the grave, whom you no longer remember, and who are cut off from your care. 
>
><sup>6</sup> You have put me in the lowest part of the Pit, in the darkest places, in the depths. 
>
><sup>7</sup> Your wrath weighs heavily on me; you have overwhelmed me with all your waves. Selah 
>
><sup>8</sup> You have distanced my friends from me; you have made me repulsive to them. I am shut in and cannot go out. 
>
><sup>9</sup> My eyes are worn out from crying. LORD, I cry out to you all day long; I spread out my hands to you. 
>
><sup>10</sup> Do you work wonders for the dead? Do departed spirits rise up to praise you? Selah 
>
><sup>11</sup> Will your faithful love be declared in the grave, your faithfulness in Abaddon? 
>
><sup>12</sup> Will your wonders be known in the darkness or your righteousness in the land of oblivion? 
>
><sup>13</sup> But I call to you for help, LORD; in the morning my prayer meets you. 
>
><sup>14</sup> LORD, why do you reject me? Why do you hide your face from me? 
>
><sup>15</sup> From my youth, I have been suffering and near death. I suffer your horrors; I am desperate. 
>
><sup>16</sup> Your wrath sweeps over me; your terrors destroy me. 
>
><sup>17</sup> They surround me like water all day long; they close in on me from every side. 
>
><sup>18</sup> You have distanced loved one and neighbor from me; darkness is my only friend.

>Psalm 77:1–12 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> I cry aloud to God, aloud to God, and he will hear me. 
>
><sup>2</sup> I sought the Lord in my day of trouble. My hands were continually lifted up all night long; I refused to be comforted. 
>
><sup>3</sup> I think of God; I groan; I meditate; my spirit becomes weak. Selah 
>
><sup>4</sup> You have kept me from closing my eyes; I am troubled and cannot speak. 
>
><sup>5</sup> I consider days of old, years long past. 
>
><sup>6</sup> At night I remember my music; I meditate in my heart, and my spirit ponders. 
>
><sup>7</sup> “Will the Lord reject forever and never again show favor? 
>
><sup>8</sup> Has his faithful love ceased forever? Is his promise at an end for all generations? 
>
><sup>9</sup> Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he in anger withheld his compassion?” Selah 
>
><sup>10</sup> So I say, “I am grieved that the right hand of the Most High has changed.” 
>
><sup>11</sup> I will remember the LORD’s works; yes, I will remember your ancient wonders. 
>
><sup>12</sup> I will reflect on all you have done and meditate on your actions.

### Let Me All Thy Love Accepting: yet being enabled by the Spirit to know the things which are freely given him of God, he may, without extraordinary revelation, in the right use of means, attain thereunto

>1 John 4:13 (CSB) This is how we know that we remain in him and he in us: He has given us of his Spirit.

>Hebrews 6:11–12 (CSB) Now we desire each of you to demonstrate the same diligence for the full assurance of your hope until the end, so that you won’t become lazy but will be imitators of those who inherit the promises through faith and perseverance.

### Let Me All Thy Love Accepting: and therefore it is the duty of every one to give all diligence to make his calling and election sure, that thereby his heart may be enlarged in peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, in love and thankfulness to God, and in strength and cheerfulness in the duties of obedience, the proper fruits of this assurance

>Romans 5:1–5 (CSB) Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. We have also obtained access through him by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we boast in the hope of the glory of God. And not only that, but we also boast in our afflictions, because we know that affliction produces endurance, endurance produces proven character, and proven character produces hope. This hope will not disappoint us, because God’s love has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.

>Romans 14:17 (CSB) for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.

>Psalm 119:32 (CSB) I pursue the way of your commands, for you broaden my understanding.

### Let Me All Thy Love Accepting: so far is it from inclining men to looseness

>Romans 6:1-2 (CSB) What should we say then? Should we continue in sin so that grace may multiply Absolutely not! How can we who died to sin still live in it?

>Titus 2:11–14 (CSB) For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, instructing us to deny godlessness and worldly lusts and to live in a sensible, righteous, and godly way in the present age, while we wait for the blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ. He gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to cleanse for himself a people for his own possession, eager to do good works.

## The Song of Praise
