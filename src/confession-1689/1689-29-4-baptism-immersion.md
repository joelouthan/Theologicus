## The Text

## The Chapter

**Immersion, or dipping of the person in water, is necessary to the due administration of this ordinance.**

## The Confession

>Matthew 3:16 (CSB) When Jesus was baptized, he went up immediately from the water. The heavens suddenly opened for him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming down on him.

>John 3:23 (CSB) John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water there. People were coming and being baptized,

I will spend very little time explaining what I have already shown. Because the Christ himself was immersed in the water by John the Baptist and by the very command of Christ (Matthew 28:19), we are to be immersed in the water.

Take time right now to remember your baptism. 

"Oh but I have sinned!" - But Christ died for us not when we were sparkling cleansed but rather, we were yet sinners?

>Romans 5:8 (CSB) But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

Did you sin before or after the cross of Christ? Not a trick question? Way way way after the cross of Christ--some two thousand years after. All of your sins were future sins when Christ nailed himself to the cross and paid your debt of sin.

"Oh, I have backslidden!" Ok? You have the Christ! You have the Holy Spirit! You are been made alive. Remember what Christ has done for you! Raise your head, turn your eyes upon the Christ, and you will not perish but have everlasting life!

>John 3:14–15 (CSB) “Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.

"Oh, did I really believe?" - oh, your faith was just a little? Is it maybe you were you newly born again? Take heart! For all of those whom he has called, he has predestined you and me to be the conformed to the image of his Son, Jesus Christ, whom "grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God" (Luke 2:52). If he promised to conform us, then he will, too, will grow us in the wisdom and stature, just like he did with his Son. It is God alone who gives maturity (1 Corinthians 3:6; Hebrews 6:3). Look upon the Christ, remember your baptism, and remember the Christ who died for you.
