# 13.3 What God Does: The Spirit Makes Us Fully Alive

## The Text

>Romans 7:22–25 (CSB)  
><sup>22</sup> For in my inner self I delight in God’s law, 
>
><sup>23</sup> but I see a different law in the parts of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and taking me prisoner to the law of sin in the parts of my body. 
>
><sup>24</sup> What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? 
>
><sup>25</sup> Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with my mind I myself am serving the law of God, but with my flesh, the law of sin.

## The Chapter

In which war, although the remaining corruption for a time may much prevail, yet, through the continual supply of strength from the sanctifying Spirit of Christ, the regenerate part does overcome; and so the saints grow in grace, perfecting holiness in the fear of God, pressing after an heavenly life, in evangelical obedience to all the commands which Christ as Head and King, in his Word has prescribed to them.

## The Confession

### In which war, although the remaining corruption for a time may much prevail

>Romans 7:23 (CSB) but I see a different law in the parts of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and taking me prisoner to the law of sin in the parts of my body.

### yet, through the continual supply of strength from the sanctifying Spirit of Christ, the regenerate part does overcome

>Romans 6:14 (CSB) For sin will not rule over you, because you are not under the law but under grace.

### and so the saints grow in grace, perfecting holiness in the fear of God, pressing after an heavenly life, in evangelical obedience to all the commands which Christ as Head and King, in his Word has prescribed to them


>Ephesians 4:15–16 (CSB) But speaking the truth in love, let us grow in every way into him who is the head—Christ. From him the whole body, fitted and knit together by every supporting ligament, promotes the growth of the body for building itself up in love by the proper working of each individual part.

>2 Corinthians 3:18 (CSB) We all, with unveiled faces, are looking as in a mirror at the glory of the Lord and are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory; this is from the Lord who is the Spirit.

>2 Corinthians 7:1 (CSB) So then, dear friends, since we have these promises, let us cleanse ourselves from every impurity of the flesh and spirit, bringing holiness to completion in the fear of God.
