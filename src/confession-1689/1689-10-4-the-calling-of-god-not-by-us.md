# 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith, Chapter 10.4 The Calling of God Not By Us

## The Text

>1 Corinthians 12:3 (CSB) Therefore I want you to know that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus is cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.

## The Chapter

### Others not elected, although they may be called by the ministry of the Word, and may have some common operations of the Spirit, yet not being effectually drawn by the Father, they neither will nor can truly come to Christ, and therefore cannot be saved: much less can men that receive not the Christian religion be saved; be they never so diligent to frame their lives according to the light of nature and the law of that religion they do profess.

## The Confession

### Others not elected, although they may be called by the ministry of the Word, and may have some common operations of the Spirit,

>Matthew 22:14 (CSB) “For many are invited, but few are chosen.”

>Matthew 13:20–21 (CSB) And the one sown on rocky ground—this is one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy. But he has no root and is short-lived. When distress or persecution comes because of the word, immediately he falls away.

>Hebrews 6:4–5 (CSB) For it is impossible to renew to repentance those who were once enlightened, who tasted the heavenly gift, who shared in the Holy Spirit, who tasted God’s good word and the powers of the coming age,

You have to deal with the magnitude, vastness and the *almight* of the Lord God Almighty. Start with the Triuneness of God. Each of the persons of the Godhead--Father, Son, and Spirit--are, by themselves, the fullness of God.

>... all infinite, without beginning, therefore but one God, who is not to be divided in nature and being, but distinguished by several peculiar relative properties and personal relations; which doctrine of the Trinity is the foundation of all our communion with God, and comfortable dependence on him.
>
>[1689.2.3 The Triune God](https://theologic.us/confession-1689/1689-02-3-the-triune-god)

And when God himself, whether it be just the Father, just the Son, or just the Spirit, does anything within this material plane, there are the effectual, precise definite work of God and the effects of God on a individual or a people group.

But when you are dealing with that amount of power--infinite, that is--you have to know that there will be residual affects of that power. Think of any sort of bomb. That bomb will destroy its intended target to be sure but the magnitude of the bomb will have residual affects on the surrounding area. And what is a bomb, even a nuclear warhead, pales in comparison to the power of God.

And that is just it: every analogy I could use to try to compare to God will more than likely be a weapon of destruction. God's holy and righteous saving power is one of salvation, healing, restoration, reconciliation, and love.

If you and I know that the almighty power of God will have residual effects, you and I must know that people might be attracted to that power but, hear this, for all the wrong reasons--even reasons that will lead to their destruction unless God saves them unto himself.

If you have been in church for longer than a moment, you have already seen people attracted to the things of God, do the things of God, and then fall away from the holiness of God for one reason or another. Christians often are perplexed that something like this could have happened. Mostly perplexed because this falling away from grace has happened to someone they know and love--like their dad, or brother, or child.

>>Hebrews 6:4–6 (CSB) For it is impossible to renew to repentance those who were once enlightened, who tasted the heavenly gift, who shared in the Holy Spirit, who tasted God’s good word and the powers of the coming age, and who have fallen away. This is because, to their own harm, they are recrucifying the Son of God and holding him up to contempt.

God said they have merely tasted the heavenly gift. Christ explains this in two places:

>Matthew 13:20–21 (CSB) And the one sown on rocky ground—this is one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy. But he has no root and is short-lived. When distress or persecution comes because of the word, immediately he falls away.

And

>Matthew 7:21–23 (CSB) “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven. On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, didn’t we prophesy in your name, drive out demons in your name, and do many miracles in your name?’ Then I will announce to them, ‘I never knew you. Depart from me, you lawbreakers!’

Christ preaches these sermons not to shake the assurance of this people but rather, to show his people the power of God. When God does something, it will come to pass. And when it does, there are affects on the fringes of that power.

God was so merciful and kind to display his glory to all of the earth. He did this by sending his Son to die for the sins of his people. Some are effectually called by God to be saved by God. Some look at what God has done and they want the gifts and power of God but cannot stand and bear his holiness and goodness. Let the world kick them in the chest, and they fall away. Let God show them who he is, and they fall away. Let the happy times leave them for a moment, and they fallen away.

But for his people, to the believer, to you and I, God saves us and holds us to the utmost.

### yet not being effectually drawn by the Father, they neither will nor can truly come to Christ, and therefore cannot be saved:

>John 6:44–65 (CSB) No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up on the last day. It is written in the Prophets: And they will all be taught by God. Everyone who has listened to and learned from the Father comes to me—not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God. He has seen the Father. “Truly I tell you, anyone who believes has eternal life. I am the bread of life. Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread that comes down from heaven so that anyone may eat of it and not die. I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread he will live forever. The bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.” At that, the Jews argued among themselves, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?” So Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life in yourselves. The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day, because my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink. The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him. Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me. This is the bread that came down from heaven; it is not like the manna your ancestors ate—and they died. The one who eats this bread will live forever.” He said these things while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum. Therefore, when many of his disciples heard this, they said, “This teaching is hard. Who can accept it?” Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were grumbling about this, asked them, “Does this offend you? Then what if you were to observe the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? The Spirit is the one who gives life. The flesh doesn’t help at all. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life. But there are some among you who don’t believe.” (For Jesus knew from the beginning those who did not believe and the one who would betray him.) He said, “This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted to him by the Father.”

>1 John 2:24–25 (CSB) What you have heard from the beginning is to remain in you. If what you have heard from the beginning remains in you, then you will remain in the Son and in the Father. And this is the promise that he himself made to us: eternal life.

And that is the hard truth we must know of God: God saves whom he will save.



### much less can men that do not receive the Christian religion be saved; be they never so diligent to frame their lives according to the light of nature and the law of that religion they do profess.

>Acts 4:12 (CSB) There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to people by which we must be saved.”

>John 4:22 (CSB) You Samaritans worship what you do not know. We worship what we do know, because salvation is from the Jews.

>John 17:3 (CSB) This is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and the one you have sent—Jesus Christ.
