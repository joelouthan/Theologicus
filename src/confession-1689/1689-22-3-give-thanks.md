## The Chapter

**Prayer, with thanksgiving, being one part of natural worship, is by God required of all men. But that it may be accepted, it is to be made in the name of the Son, by the help of the Spirit, according to his will; with understanding, reverence, humility, fervency, faith, love, and perseverance; and when with others, in a known tongue.**

## The Confession

### Prayer, with thanksgiving, being one part of natural worship, is by God required of all men

>Psalm 95:1–7 (CSB) Come, let’s shout joyfully to the LORD, shout triumphantly to the rock of our salvation! Let’s enter his presence with thanksgiving; let’s shout triumphantly to him in song. For the LORD is a great God, a great King above all gods. The depths of the earth are in his hand, and the mountain peaks are his. The sea is his; he made it. His hands formed the dry land. Come, let’s worship and bow down; let’s kneel before the LORD our Maker. For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, the sheep under his care. Today, if you hear his voice:

>Psalm 65:2 (CSB) All humanity will come to you, the one who hears prayer.

### But that it may be accepted, it is to be made in the name of the Son

>John 14:13–14 (CSB) Whatever you ask in my name, I will do it so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.

### by the help of the Spirit

>Romans 8:26 (CSB) In the same way the Spirit also helps us in our weakness, because we do not know what to pray for as we should, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with inexpressible groanings.

### according to his will

>1 John 5:14 (CSB) This is the confidence we have before him: If we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.

### with understanding, reverence, humility, fervency, faith, love, and perseverance; and when with others, in a known tongue

>1 Corinthians 14:16–17 (CSB) Otherwise, if you praise with the spirit, how will the outsider say “Amen” at your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you are saying? For you may very well be giving thanks, but the other person is not being built up.
