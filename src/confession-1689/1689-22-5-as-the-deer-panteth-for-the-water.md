### Worship: As The Deer Panteth For The Water

## The Text

## The Chapter

### The reading of the Scriptures, preaching, and hearing the Word of God, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in our hearts to the Lord; as also the administration of baptism, and the Lord's supper, are all parts of religious worship of God, to be performed in obedience to him, with understanding, faith, reverence, and godly fear; moreover, solemn humiliation, with fastings, and thanksgivings, upon special occasions, ought to be used in an holy and religious manner.

## The Confession

### The reading of the Scriptures

>1 Timothy 4:13 (CSB) Until I come, give your attention to public reading, exhortation, and teaching.

### preaching, and hearing the Word of God

>2 Timothy 4:2 (CSB) Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; correct, rebuke, and encourage with great patience and teaching.

>Luke 8:18 (CSB) Therefore take care how you listen. For whoever has, more will be given to him; and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him.”

### teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in our hearts to the Lord

>Colossians 3:16 (CSB) Let the word of Christ dwell richly among you, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another through psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts.

>Ephesians 5:19 (CSB) speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making music with your heart to the Lord,

### as also the administration of baptism

>Matthew 28:19–20 (CSB) Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe everything I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”

### and the Lord's supper

>1 Corinthians 11:26 (CSB) For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.

### are all parts of religious worship of God, to be performed in obedience to him, with understanding, faith, reverence, and godly fear; moreover, solemn humiliation, with fastings

>Esther 4:16 (CSB) “Go and assemble all the Jews who can be found in Susa and fast for me. Don’t eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my female servants will also fast in the same way. After that, I will go to the king even if it is against the law. If I perish, I perish.”

>Joel 2:12 (CSB) Even now— this is the LORD’s declaration— turn to me with all your heart, with fasting, weeping, and mourning.

### and thanksgivings, upon special occasions, ought to be used in an holy and religious manner

>Exodus 15:1–19 (CSB) Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD. They said: I will sing to the LORD, for he is highly exalted; he has thrown the horse and its rider into the sea. The LORD is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation. This is my God, and I will praise him, my father’s God, and I will exalt him. The LORD is a warrior; the LORD is his name. He threw Pharaoh’s chariots and his army into the sea; the elite of his officers were drowned in the Red Sea. The floods covered them; they sank to the depths like a stone. LORD, your right hand is glorious in power. LORD, your right hand shattered the enemy. You overthrew your adversaries by your great majesty. You unleashed your burning wrath; it consumed them like stubble. The water heaped up at the blast from your nostrils; the currents stood firm like a dam. The watery depths congealed in the heart of the sea. The enemy said: “I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil. My desire will be gratified at their expense. I will draw my sword; my hand will destroy them.” But you blew with your breath, and the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters. LORD, who is like you among the gods? Who is like you, glorious in holiness, revered with praises, performing wonders? You stretched out your right hand, and the earth swallowed them. With your faithful love, you will lead the people you have redeemed; you will guide them to your holy dwelling with your strength. When the peoples hear, they will shudder; anguish will seize the inhabitants of Philistia. Then the chiefs of Edom will be terrified; trembling will seize the leaders of Moab; all the inhabitants of Canaan will panic; terror and dread will fall on them. They will be as still as a stone because of your powerful arm until your people pass by, LORD, until the people whom you purchased pass by. You will bring them in and plant them on the mountain of your possession; LORD, you have prepared the place for your dwelling; Lord, your hands have established the sanctuary. The LORD will reign forever and ever! When Pharaoh’s horses with his chariots and horsemen went into the sea, the LORD brought the water of the sea back over them. But the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground.

><sup>3</sup> and has gathered them from the lands— from the east and the west, from the north and the south. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Some wandered in the desolate wilderness, finding no way to a city where they could live.

><sup>9</sup> For he has satisfied the thirsty and filled the hungry with good things. 
>
><sup>10</sup> Others sat in darkness and gloom— prisoners in cruel chains— 
>
><sup>11</sup> because they rebelled against God’s commands and despised the counsel of the Most High. 
>
><sup>12</sup> He broke their spirits with hard labor; they stumbled, and there was no one to help. 
>
><sup>13</sup> Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble; he saved them from their distress. 
>
><sup>14</sup> He brought them out of darkness and gloom and broke their chains apart. 
>
><sup>15</sup> Let them give thanks to the LORD for his faithful love and his wondrous works for all humanity. 
>
><sup>16</sup> For he has broken down the bronze gates and cut through the iron bars. 
>
><sup>17</sup> Fools suffered affliction because of their rebellious ways and their iniquities.

>
><sup>25</sup> He spoke and raised a stormy wind that stirred up the waves of the sea. 
>
><sup>26</sup> Rising up to the sky, sinking down to the depths, their courage melting away in anguish, 
>
><sup>27</sup> they reeled and staggered like a drunkard, and all their skill was useless. 
>
><sup>28</sup> Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and he brought them out of their distress. 
>
><sup>29</sup> He stilled the storm to a whisper, and the waves of the sea were hushed. 
>
><sup>30</sup> They rejoiced when the waves grew quiet. Then he guided them to the harbor they longed for. 
>
><sup>31</sup> Let them give thanks to the LORD for his faithful love and his wondrous works for all humanity. 
>
><sup>32</sup> Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people and praise him in the council of the elders. 
>
><sup>33</sup> He turns rivers into desert, springs into thirsty ground, 
>
><sup>34</sup> and fruitful land into salty wasteland, because of the wickedness of its inhabitants. 
>
><sup>35</sup> He turns a desert into a pool, dry land into springs. 
>
><sup>36</sup> He causes the hungry to settle there, and they establish a city where they can live. 
>
><sup>37</sup> They sow fields and plant vineyards that yield a fruitful harvest. 
>
><sup>38</sup> He blesses them, and they multiply greatly; he does not let their livestock decrease. 
>
><sup>39</sup> When they are diminished and are humbled by cruel oppression and sorrow, 
>
><sup>40</sup> he pours contempt on nobles and makes them wander in a trackless wasteland. 
>
><sup>41</sup> But he lifts the needy out of their suffering and makes their families multiply like flocks. 
>
><sup>42</sup> The upright see it and rejoice, and all injustice shuts its mouth. 
>
><sup>43</sup> Let whoever is wise pay attention to these things and consider the LORD’s acts of faithful love.
