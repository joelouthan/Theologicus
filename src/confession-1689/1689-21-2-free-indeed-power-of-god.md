## The Text

>Romans 6:1–4 (CSB) What should we say then? Should we continue in sin so that grace may multiply? Absolutely not! How can we who died to sin still live in it? Or are you unaware that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? Therefore we were buried with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too may walk in newness of life.

## The Chapter

**God alone is Lord of the conscience, and hath left it free from the doctrines and commandments of men which are in any thing contrary to his word, or not contained in it. So that to believe such doctrines, or obey such commands out of conscience, is to betray true liberty of conscience; and the requiring of an implicit faith, an absolute and blind obedience, is to destroy liberty of conscience and reason also.**

## The Confession

### God alone is Lord of the conscience

>James 4:12 (CSB) There is one lawgiver and judge who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?

>Romans 14:4 (CSB) Who are you to judge another’s household servant? Before his own Lord he stands or falls. And he will stand, because the Lord is able to make him stand.

### and has left it free from the doctrines and commandments of men which are in any thing contrary to his word, or not contained in it

>Acts 4:19–29 (CSB) Peter and John answered them, “Whether it’s right in the sight of God for us to listen to you rather than to God, you decide; for we are unable to stop speaking about what we have seen and heard.” After threatening them further, they released them. They found no way to punish them because the people were all giving glory to God over what had been done. For this sign of healing had been performed on a man over forty years old. After they were released, they went to their own people and reported everything the chief priests and the elders had said to them. When they heard this, they raised their voices together to God and said, “Master, you are the one who made the heaven, the earth, and the sea, and everything in them. You said through the Holy Spirit, by the mouth of our father David your servant: Why do the Gentiles rage and the peoples plot futile things? The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers assemble together against the Lord and against his Messiah. “For, in fact, in this city both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, assembled together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, to do whatever your hand and your will had predestined to take place. And now, Lord, consider their threats, and grant that your servants may speak your word with all boldness,

>1 Corinthians 7:23 (CSB) You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of people.

>Matthew 15:9 (CSB) They worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines human commands.”

### So that to believe such doctrines, or obey such commands out of conscience, is to betray true liberty of conscience
>Colossians 2:20–23 (CSB) If you died with Christ to the elements of this world, why do you live as if you still belonged to the world? Why do you submit to regulations: “Don’t handle, don’t taste, don’t touch”? All these regulations refer to what is destined to perish by being used up; they are human commands and doctrines. Although these have a reputation for wisdom by promoting self-made religion, false humility, and severe treatment of the body, they are not of any value in curbing self-indulgence.

### and the requiring of an implicit faith, an absolute and blind obedience, is to destroy liberty of conscience and reason also

>1 Corinthians 3:5 (CSB) What then is Apollos? What is Paul? They are servants through whom you believed, and each has the role the Lord has given.

>2 Corinthians 1:24 (CSB) I do not mean that we lord it over your faith, but we are workers with you for your joy, because you stand firm in your faith.
