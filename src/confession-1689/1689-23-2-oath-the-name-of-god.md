## The Text

## The Chapter

**The name of God only is that by which men ought to swear; and therein it is to be used, with all holy fear and reverence; therefore to swear vainly or rashly by that glorious and dreadful name, or to swear at all by any other thing, is sinful, and to be abhorred; yet as in matter of weight and moment, for confirmation of truth, and ending all strife, an oath is warranted by the word of God; so a lawful oath being imposed by lawful authority in such matters, ought to be taken.**

## The Confession

### The name of God only is that by which men ought to swear; and therein it is to be used, with all holy fear and reverence; therefore to swear vainly or rashly by that glorious and dreadful name, or to swear at all by any other thing, is sinful, and to be abhorred

>Matthew 5:34–37 (CSB) But I tell you, don’t take an oath at all: either by heaven, because it is God’s throne; or by the earth, because it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King. Do not swear by your head, because you cannot make a single hair white or black. But let your ‘yes’ mean ‘yes,’ and your ‘no’ mean ‘no.’ Anything more than this is from the evil one.

>James 5:12 (CSB) Above all, my brothers and sisters, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath. But let your “yes” mean “yes,” and your “no” mean “no,” so that you won’t fall under judgment.

### yet as in matter of weight and moment, for confirmation of truth, and ending all strife, an oath is warranted by the word of God

>Hebrews 6:16 (CSB) For people swear by something greater than themselves, and for them a confirming oath ends every dispute.

>2 Corinthians 1:23 (CSB) I call on God as a witness, on my life, that it was to spare you that I did not come to Corinth.

### so a lawful oath being imposed by lawful authority in such matters, ought to be taken

>Nehemiah 13:25 (CSB) I rebuked them, cursed them, beat some of their men, and pulled out their hair. I forced them to take an oath before God and said, “You must not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters as wives for your sons or yourselves!
