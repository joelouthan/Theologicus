# 18.2 On the Mount of Crucifixion: We Are Washed Clean by the Blood of Christ

## The Text

>Revelation 12:10-12 (CSB)  
>Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say,  
>The salvation and the power  
>and the kingdom of our God  
>and the authority of his Christ  
>have now come,  
>because the accuser of our brothers and sisters,  
>who accuses them  
>before our God day and night,  
>has been thrown down.  
>They conquered him  
>by the blood of the Lamb  
>and by the word of their testimony;  
>for they did not love their lives  
>to the point of death.  
>Therefore rejoice, you heavens,  
>and you who dwell in them!  
>Woe to the earth and the sea,  
>because the devil has come down to you  
>with great fury,  
>because he knows his time is short.

## The Chapter

### This certainty is not a bare conjectural and probable persuasion grounded upon a fallible hope, but an infallible assurance of faith founded on the blood and righteousness of Christ revealed in the Gospel; and also upon the inward evidence of those graces of the Spirit unto which promises are made, and on the testimony of the Spirit of adoption, witnessing with our spirits that we are the children of God; and, as a fruit thereof, keeping the heart both humble and holy.

## The Confession

### This certainty is not a bare conjectural and probable persuasion grounded upon a fallible hope, but an infallible assurance of faith

>Hebrews 6:11–19 (CSB) Now we desire each of you to demonstrate the same diligence for the full assurance of your hope until the end, so that you won’t become lazy but will be imitators of those who inherit the promises through faith and perseverance. For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater to swear by, he swore by himself: I will indeed bless you, and I will greatly multiply you. And so, after waiting patiently, Abraham obtained the promise. For people swear by something greater than themselves, and for them a confirming oath ends every dispute. Because God wanted to show his unchangeable purpose even more clearly to the heirs of the promise, he guaranteed it with an oath, so that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to seize the hope set before us. We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain.

### founded on the blood and righteousness of Christ revealed in the Gospel

>Hebrews 6:17–18 (CSB) Because God wanted to show his unchangeable purpose even more clearly to the heirs of the promise, he guaranteed it with an oath, so that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to seize the hope set before us.

### and also upon the inward evidence of those graces of the Spirit unto which promises are made

>2 Peter 1:4–11 (CSB) By these he has given us very great and precious promises, so that through them you may share in the divine nature, escaping the corruption that is in the world because of evil desire. For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with goodness, goodness with knowledge, knowledge with self-control, self-control with endurance, endurance with godliness, godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love. For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being useless or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. The person who lacks these things is blind and shortsighted and has forgotten the cleansing from his past sins. Therefore, brothers and sisters, make every effort to confirm your calling and election, because if you do these things you will never stumble. For in this way, entry into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly provided for you.

### and on the testimony of the Spirit of adoption, witnessing with our spirits that we are the children of God

>Romans 8:15–16 (CSB) For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear. Instead, you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father!” The Spirit himself testifies together with our spirit that we are God’s children,

### and, as a fruit thereof, keeping the heart both humble and holy

>1 John 3:1–3 (CSB) See what great love the Father has given us that we should be called God’s children—and we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it didn’t know him. Dear friends, we are God’s children now, and what we will be has not yet been revealed. We know that when he appears, we will be like him because we will see him as he is. And everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself just as he is pure.

## The Song of Praise

>> On the mount of crucifixion,  
>> Fountains opened deep and wide;  
>> Thro’ the flood gates of God’s mercy  
>> Flow’d the vast and gracious tide;  
>> Grace and love like mighty rivers  
>> Pour’d incessant from above,  
>> And heav’n’s peace and perfect justice  
>> Kissed a guilty world in love.[^1]
