## The Chapter

**In this ordinance Christ is not offered up to his Father, nor any real sacrifice made at all for remission of sin of the quick or dead, but only a memorial of that one offering up of himself by himself upon the cross, once for all; and a spiritual oblation of all possible praise unto God for the same. So that the popish sacrifice of the mass, as they call it, is most abominable, injurious to Christ's own sacrifice the alone propitiation for all the sins of the elect.**

## The Confession

### In this ordinance Christ is not offered up to his Father, nor any real sacrifice made at all for remission of sin of the quick or dead, but only a memorial of that one offering up of himself by himself upon the cross, once for all

>Hebrews 9:25–28 (CSB) He did not do this to offer himself many times, as the high priest enters the sanctuary yearly with the blood of another. Otherwise, he would have had to suffer many times since the foundation of the world. But now he has appeared one time, at the end of the ages, for the removal of sin by the sacrifice of himself. And just as it is appointed for people to die once—and after this, judgment—so also Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.

### and a spiritual oblation of all possible praise unto God for the same. So that the popish sacrifice of the mass, as they call it, is most abominable, injurious to Christ's own sacrifice the alone propitiation for all the sins of the elect

>1 Corinthians 11:24 (CSB) and when he had given thanks, broke it, and said, “This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”

>Matthew 26:26–27 (CSB) As they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, gave it to the disciples, and said, “Take and eat it; this is my body.” Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks, he gave it to them and said, “Drink from it, all of you.

We are in lockstep with all Christians when it comes to the basis of our faith--Catholic, Orthodox, and other Protestants alike.

Where we differ is in the application of that faith. In the subject of Communion, we firmly believe that this is a memorial of what the Christ has done for us.

We vehemently disagree with Rome that communion is the necessity re-crucifying of Christ every Sunday because you and I have sinned during the week prior.

Christ's sacrifice is completely sufficient for the sins of the elect, once and for all time. It was a done deal.

Hebrews 10 is explicitly clear on this point:

>Hebrews 10:11-18 (CSB) Every priest stands day after day ministering and offering the same sacrifices time after time, which can never take away sins. But this man, after offering one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God. He is now waiting until his enemies are made his footstool. For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are sanctified. The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. For after he says:  
>This is the covenant I will make with them  
>after those days,  
>the Lord says,  
>I will put my laws on their hearts  
>and write them on their minds,  
>and I will never again remember  
>their sins and their lawless acts.  
>Now where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer an offering for sin

Recrucifying the Christ is not even possible. With concerning apostates, the author of Hebrews says:

>Hebrews 6:4–6 (CSB) For it is impossible to renew to repentance those who were once enlightened, who tasted the heavenly gift, who shared in the Holy Spirit, who tasted God’s good word and the powers of the coming age, and who have fallen away. This is because, to their own harm, they are recrucifying the Son of God and holding him up to contempt.

For the judgment on apostates--those who pretended to know the Christ and enjoyed his gifts but fell away later--it is impossible to renew them to repentance because they are recrucifying the Christ.

Recrucifying the Christ is not possible because it isn't a thing.

Turn eyes upon the Christ. Believe and trust him. How did you do that? Because before Genesis, the Christ made a covenant with the Father to save you. And he did so by condescending himself to be born of a virgin, dirt poor, no obvious wealth, power nor beauty, lived and died and resurrected for you. Now you have been resurrected from your sins because of him and with him into life.

That is how you were able to look up on the Christ and be saved.

No need to recrucify him. The Christ was already crucified once 2000 years ago.
