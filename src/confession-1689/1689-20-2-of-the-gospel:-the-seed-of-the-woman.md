# 20.2 Of The Gospel: The Seed of the Woman

## The Text

>Genesis 3:15 (CSB) I will put hostility between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring. He will strike your head, and you will strike his heel.

## The Chapter

### This promise of Christ, and salvation by him, is revealed only by the Word of God; neither do the works of creation or providence, with the light of nature, make discovery of Christ, or of grace by him, so much as in a general or obscure way; much less that men destitute of the revelation of Him by the promise or gospel, should be enabled thereby to attain saving faith or repentance.

## The Confession

### This promise of Christ, and salvation by him, is revealed only by the Word of God

>Romans 1:17 (CSB) For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, just as it is written: The righteous will live by faith.

### neither do the works of creation or providence, with the light of nature, make discovery of Christ, or of grace by him, so much as in a general or obscure way

>Romans 10:14–17 (CSB) How, then, can they call on him they have not believed in? And how can they believe without hearing about him? And how can they hear without a preacher? And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news. But not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our message? So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the message about Christ.

### much less that men destitute of the revelation of Him by the promise or gospel, should be enabled thereby to attain saving faith or repentance

>Proverbs 29:18 (CSB) Without revelation people run wild, but one who follows divine instruction will be happy.

>Isaiah 25:7 (CSB) On this mountain he will swallow up the burial shroud, the shroud over all the peoples, the sheet covering all the nations.

>Isaiah 60:2–3 (CSB) For look, darkness will cover the earth, and total darkness the peoples; but the LORD will shine over you, and his glory will appear over you. Nations will come to your light, and kings to your shining brightness.
