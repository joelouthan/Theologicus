## The Text

>Matthew 28:19–20 (CSB) Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe everything I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”

## The Chapter

**The outward element to be used in this ordinance is water, wherein the party is to be baptized, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.**

## The Confession

>Acts 8:38 (CSB) So he ordered the chariot to stop, and both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and he baptized him.

Some might feel like Chapter 29 on Baptism is deeply specific detailed--almost to a fault.

Why does it matter if only those ordained baptize you?

Why does it matter the method of baptism?

Why does it matter the words said during baptism?

Why does it matter if it is water?

The scriptural prooftext for baptism to be done in water is too numerous to list here in a commentary like the one you hold in your hand. But let me start with the first three just in the Old Testament that pointed forward to the baptism in the New Testament.

## Sheer power of water washes everything away

>Genesis 6:17 (CSB) “Understand that I am bringing a flood—floodwaters on the earth to destroy every creature under heaven with the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish.

All those who were not in the gracious favor of the Almighty God were washed away in the flood--sparing no one but Noah and his family. Remember the teaching from Genesis 6. Did Noah and his family sin? Yes, did so continuously (Genesis 6:5). But they were in the favor of God--they were saved by grace through faith (Genesis 6:8).

### Sheer power of water washes away all of your real enemies

>Exodus 14:26-28 (CSB) Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the water may come back on the Egyptians, on their chariots and horsemen.” So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the sea returned to its normal depth. While the Egyptians were trying to escape from it, the LORD threw them into the sea. The water came back and covered the chariots and horsemen, plus the entire army of Pharaoh that had gone after them into the sea. Not even one of them survived.

Those sins that continuously haunt you and chase you--the Lord was so good to cleanse you of them. You fallen into sin? Do not despair. Exercise freely the gift of faith and repentance. Turn away from your sin, turn to the Christ, and he will wash you clean.

>1 John 1:9 (CSB) If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

### Sheer power of water cleanses you from all filth

>2 Kings 5:14 (CSB) So Naaman went down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times, according to the command of the man of God. Then his skin was restored and became like the skin of a small boy, and he was clean.

Americans, by and large, bath everyday. We want to be clean and smell good. And water is the best method of cleaning our bodies. Ahhh, it feels good to be clean.

Why do I keep mentioning the sheer power of water? Remember John 3:

>John 3:5 (CSB) Jesus answered, “Truly I tell you, unless someone is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.

I used to think water in this case was "being born of a woman" but that doesn't hold up to the rest of scripture. What does line up is water, being used by God, as a means of cleansing.

>Titus 3:5 (CSB) he saved us—not by works of righteousness that we had done, but according to his mercy—through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit.

>Hebrews 10:22 (CSB) let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed in pure water.

>Ezekiel 36:25 (CSB) I will also sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your impurities and all your idols.

>1 Peter 3:21 (CSB) Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you (not as the removal of dirt from the body, but the pledge of a good conscience toward God) through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,

How we think of the sheer power to clean what is dirty, just think how much more powerful that the Almighty Spirit does in your heart and soul and cleanses you from all unrighteousness--all because of what Christ has done for you and me.

Let us praise the Lord.
