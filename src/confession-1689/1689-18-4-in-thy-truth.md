# 18.4 In Thy Truth Thou Dost Direct Me: We Can Never Be Separate From The Love of God in Christ

## The Song

>> In Thy truth Thou dost direct me  
>> By Thy Spirit through Thy Word;  
>> And Thy grace my need is meeting,  
>> As I trust in Thee, my Lord.  
>> All Thy fullness Thou art pouring  
>> In Thy love and power in me  
>> Without measure, full and boundless,  
>> As I yield myself to Thee.[^1]

## The Chapter

### True believers may have the assurance of their salvation divers ways shaken, diminished, and intermitted; as by negligence in preserving of it, by falling into some special sin which woundeth the conscience and grieveth the Spirit; by some sudden or vehement temptation, by God's withdrawing the light of his countenance, and suffering even such as fear him to walk in darkness and to have no light, yet are they never destitute of the seed of God and life of faith, that love of Christ and the brethren, that sincerity of heart and conscience of duty out of which, by the operation of the Spirit, this assurance may in due time be revived, and by the which, in the meantime, they are preserved from utter despair.

## The Confession

### True believers may have the assurance of their salvation divers ways shaken, diminished, and intermitted; as by negligence in preserving of it

>Song of Solomon 5:2–6 (CSB) I was sleeping, but my heart was awake. A sound! My love was knocking! Open to me, my sister, my darling, my dove, my perfect one. For my head is drenched with dew, my hair with droplets of the night. I have taken off my clothing. How can I put it back on? I have washed my feet. How can I get them dirty? My love thrust his hand through the opening, and my feelings were stirred for him. I rose to open for my love. My hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with flowing myrrh on the handles of the bolt. I opened to my love, but my love had turned and gone away. My heart sank because he had left. I sought him, but did not find him. I called him, but he did not answer.

### by falling into some special sin which wounds the conscience and grieves the Spirit

>Psalm 51:8–14 (CSB) Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones you have crushed rejoice. Turn your face away from my sins and blot out all my guilt. God, create a clean heart for me and renew a steadfast spirit within me. Do not banish me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me. Restore the joy of your salvation to me, and sustain me by giving me a willing spirit. Then I will teach the rebellious your ways, and sinners will return to you. Save me from the guilt of bloodshed, God— God of my salvation— and my tongue will sing of your righteousness.

### by some sudden or vehement temptation

>Psalm 116:11 (CSB) In my alarm I said, “Everyone is a liar.”

>Psalm 77:7–8 (CSB) “Will the Lord reject forever and never again show favor? Has his faithful love ceased forever? Is his promise at an end for all generations?

>Psalm 31:22 (CSB) In my alarm I said, “I am cut off from your sight.” But you heard the sound of my pleading when I cried to you for help.

### by God's withdrawing the light of his countenance, and suffering even such as fear him to walk in darkness and to have no light

>Psalm 30:7 (CSB) LORD, when you showed your favor, you made me stand like a strong mountain; when you hid your face, I was terrified.

### yet are they never destitute of the seed of God

>1 John 3:9 (CSB) Everyone who has been born of God does not sin, because his seed remains in him; he is not able to sin, because he has been born of God.

### and life of faith

>Luke 22:32 (CSB) But I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail. And you, when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.”

### that love of Christ and the brethren, that sincerity of heart and conscience of duty out of which, by the operation of the Spirit, this assurance may in due time be revived

>Psalm 42:5–11 (CSB) Why, my soul, are you so dejected? Why are you in such turmoil? Put your hope in God, for I will still praise him, my Savior and my God. I am deeply depressed; therefore I remember you from the land of Jordan and the peaks of Hermon, from Mount Mizar. Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls; all your breakers and your billows have swept over me. The LORD will send his faithful love by day; his song will be with me in the night— a prayer to the God of my life. I will say to God, my rock, “Why have you forgotten me? Why must I go about in sorrow because of the enemy’s oppression?” My adversaries taunt me, as if crushing my bones, while all day long they say to me, “Where is your God?” Why, my soul, are you so dejected? Why are you in such turmoil? Put your hope in God, for I will still praise him, my Savior and my God.

### and by the which, in the meantime, they are preserved from utter despair.

>Lamentations 3:26–31 (CSB) It is good to wait quietly for salvation from the LORD. It is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is still young. Let him sit alone and be silent, for God has disciplined him. Let him put his mouth in the dust— perhaps there is still hope. Let him offer his cheek to the one who would strike him; let him be filled with disgrace. For the Lord will not reject us forever.
