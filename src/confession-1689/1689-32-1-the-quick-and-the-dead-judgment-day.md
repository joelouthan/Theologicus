## The Text

>Oh close and blessed union! Justified by God, accepted in Christ, condemnation there cannot be. I stand in the Divine presence as Joshua stood before the Lord, or as the woman stood before the Savior, charged, accused, guilty; but I am in the presence of him who, though now he sits upon the throne as my Judge, once hung upon the cross as my Savior. And, investing me with his own spotless robe, he proceeds to pronounce the sentence- "NO CONDEMNATION!"

## The Chapter

**God hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in righteousness, by Jesus Christ; to whom all power and judgment is given of the Father; in which day, not only the apostate angels shall be judged, but likewise all persons that have lived upon the earth shall appear before the tribunal of Christ, to give an account of their thoughts, words, and deeds, and to receive according to what they have done in the body, whether good or evil.**

## The Confession

### God has appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in righteousness, by Jesus Christ

>Acts 17:31 because he has set a day when he is going to judge the world in righteousness by the man he has appointed. He has provided proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead.”

>John 5:22–27 The Father, in fact, judges no one but has given all judgment to the Son, so that all people may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Anyone who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him. “Truly I tell you, anyone who hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not come under judgment but has passed from death to life. “Truly I tell you, an hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. For just as the Father has life in himself, so also he has granted to the Son to have life in himself. And he has granted him the right to pass judgment, because he is the Son of Man.

### to whom all power and judgment is given of the Father; in which day, not only the apostate angels shall be judged

>1 Corinthians 6:3 Don’t you know that we will judge angels—how much more matters of this life?

>Jude 6 and the angels who did not keep their own position but abandoned their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains in deep darkness for the judgment on the great day.

### but likewise all persons that have lived upon the earth shall appear before the tribunal of Christ, to give an account of their thoughts, words, and deeds, and to receive according to what they have done in the body, whether good or evil

>2 Corinthians 5:10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each may be repaid for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil.

>Ecclesiastes 12:14 For God will bring every act to judgment, including every hidden thing, whether good or evil.

>Matthew 12:36 I tell you that on the day of judgment people will have to account for every careless word they speak.

>Romans 14:10–12 But you, why do you judge your brother or sister? Or you, why do you despise your brother or sister? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God. For it is written, As I live, says the Lord, every knee will bow to me, and every tongue will give praise to God. So then, each of us will give an account of himself to God.

>Matthew 25:32–46 All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate them one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on the left. Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. “ ‘For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat; I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink; I was a stranger and you took me in; I was naked and you clothed me; I was sick and you took care of me; I was in prison and you visited me.’ “Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and take you in, or without clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick, or in prison, and visit you?’ “And the King will answer them, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’ “Then he will also say to those on the left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels! For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat; I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink; I was a stranger and you didn’t take me in; I was naked and you didn’t clothe me, sick and in prison and you didn’t take care of me.’ “Then they too will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or without clothes, or sick, or in prison, and not help you?’ “Then he will answer them, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’ “And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”

We have arrived. It is Judgment day! We stand all before the Alpha and the Omega. The Beginning and the End. The Only Faithful, The Only True. The Only Justice. The Warbringer. The Enemy Conquerors. The Worthy Lamb Who Slain is He. Holy, Holy, Holy is He. In his unrestricted, unlimited, unapologetic, full maxed out glory. Upon his head, a crown of crowns--with his name that only he knows himself. His eyes full of flame. His robe freshly dipped in the blood of his slain enemies.

Sharp sword drew out of his mouth--the Nation Striker. He rules with a rod of iron--the Nation Crusher. His feet and robe stained with the blood of his enemies whom he presses in his right wrath forever and ever.

His name?

Written on his robe and tatted on his thigh: **KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS**.

The Word of God.

The Son of Man.

The only begotten of the Father.

The Son of God.

The Lord Jesus Christ, the only Savior and Messiah.

The One True Judge.

And we stand before him. Helpless. In fear and trembling, we stand and fall before him.

You see and hear those judged before you. They grit their teeth. They are scrambling for a defense. They are trying to justify their existence.

"God, look at the good I have done! Look, I was a pastor. Look, I feed the poor and clothed the naked. Didn't you say do that? Didn't I do good? Look, I donated to the poor. I led millions to you. I healed people. I drove out demons. I did what you asked me to do. I did good. LET ME IN."

Effortlessly, the Lord Jesus Christ, responds with no explanation, "DEPART FROM ME YOU WORKER OF LAWLESSNESS. I NEVER KNEW YOU."

And real, tangible fear grips you. You are next. You haven't done anything good. Nothing spectacular. I haven't healed not once. I was not a pastor. I did not do good as I ought. Is my faith enough? Oh my God!

And you fall on your face. And words cannot even come out your mouth because... you can't speak.

But that still small voice, the One that was with you when you first knew God. The same comfort then is the same comfort now. That Voice tells you sweetly, "don't you worry-- I got you."

With full confidence, this voice speaks perfectly to the heavens, "Father, this is your adopted child--whom you loved since before you set the foundation of the world. He has the exact same righteousness as your only begotten Son!"

The Christ, the Son of God, with a smirk, if you will, turns to the Father, "Father, what do you got to say?"

The Father, the All Confirming, boom with a voice that shakes the core of every one, "This is my beloved child, in whom I am well pleased."

And even before the Father could even finished, the Son of Man already stands, almost in sync with the Father, descends from his thrones, pulls off off his robes and comes straight to you. He picks you up, and holds you close to his chest. And as he holds you, He turns to the heavens, and adamantly declares, "NO CONDEMNATION! Enter into the joy of your master."

I tell you these things so that your joy may be full.
