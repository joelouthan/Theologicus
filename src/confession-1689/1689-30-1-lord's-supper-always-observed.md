## The Text

>1 Corinthians 11:23–26 For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: On the night when he was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, broke it, and said, “This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, and said, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.

## The Chapter

**The supper of the Lord Jesus was instituted by him the same night wherein he was betrayed, to be observed in his churches, unto the end of the world, for the perpetual remembrance, and shewing forth the sacrifice of himself in his death, confirmation of the faith of believers in all the benefits thereof, their spiritual nourishment, and growth in him, their further engagement in, and to all duties which they owe to him; and to be a bond and pledge of their communion with him, and with each other.**

## The Confession

>1 Corinthians 10:16–21 The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a sharing in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a sharing in the body of Christ? Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, since all of us share the one bread. Consider the people of Israel. Do not those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar? What am I saying then? That food sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? No, but I do say that what they sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons! You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot share in the Lord’s table and the table of demons.

I will say only this: why do we go to church? Is it worship God? Yes. Is it to sit under the preaching of the word? Absolutely. Is it pray and confess and be given of assurance. All of that.

But there is one thing that the entire Lord's Day points to: we go to the service to receive the only thing that we absolutely need that can only be given by God the Father himself--that his only begotten Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.

And we receive the Son of God in the Lord's Supper--the bread and the wine.

You are receiving the Christ.

Pastors, you as ministers are given the Christ to each individual and blessing them with the Christ.

So my question is this: why would you not do this every Lord's Day service? You get to partake of the Christ. Would you not want it every Sunday?

Give me the Christ!
