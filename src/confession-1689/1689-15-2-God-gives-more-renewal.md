# 15.2 God Gives More: Renewal

## The Text

## The Chapter

Whereas there is none that doth good and sinneth not, and the best of men may, through the power and deceitfulness of their corruption dwelling in them, with the prevalency of temptation, fall into great sins and provocations; God hath, in the covenant of grace, mercifully provided that believers so sinning and falling be renewed through repentance unto salvation.

## The Confession

>Ecclesiastes 7:20 (CSB) There is certainly no one righteous on the earth who does good and never sins.

>Luke 22:31–32 (CSB) “Simon, Simon, look out. Satan has asked to sift you like wheat. But I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail. And you, when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.”
