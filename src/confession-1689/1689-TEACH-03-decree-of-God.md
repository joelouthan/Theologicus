## Prayer

## The Intro

## The Decree of God

### In of Himself

- No other being
  - Triune-ness

### Freely and Unchangeably

- The Freedom of God
- We have no freedom

If we could save ourselves, *would we*? Not a trick question. Because of our sin, the answer is no. Why? Because we would only be interested in saving ourselves to ourselves. Because of sin, we would not save ourselves to the sinless holy one of God? We would not fly to God but rather, dig deep into ourselves.

We have no freedom to run to the God that saves. But God freely ran to us by sending his Son to live and die for us.

### Without Conditions



### whatsoever comes to pass

>Romans 9:15â€“18 (CSB) For he tells Moses, I will show mercy to whom I will show mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. So then, it does not depend on human will or effort but on God who shows mercy. For the Scripture tells Pharaoh, I raised you up for this reason so that I may display my power in you and that my name may be proclaimed in the whole earth. So then, he has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy and he hardens whom he wants to harden.

And herein lies the rub: we are not free to do as we please. And when the Almighty God, who possesses all power and strength, does something that we don't want to do or one step further, does something that interferes with our little lives, we become upset. We become upset that we can't do as we please and we are limited by sin at all times.

God, in his compassion and mercy, willfully saved us from our sins. The book of Exodus summed up in the 9th chapter of Romans demonstrates one thing clear: God is not above building up an empire and a king and bringing it low unto death so that his people are saved to the glory of his name.


## So what?

**Although God knows whatsoever may or can come to pass, upon all supposed conditions, yet had he not decreed anything, because he foresaw it as future, or as that which would come to pass upon such conditions.**

- Romans 5:8 Corridors of time
  - Did not save us based on our goodness
  - Also did not save us because on our wickedness'
  - We are the ones that needed to be saved
  - God needs nothing
  - But God freely gives

Out of his perfect wisdom and perfect goodness, God gives us love, grace, and mercy--perfectly and forever.

### Love of God

### Grace of God

### Mercies of God
