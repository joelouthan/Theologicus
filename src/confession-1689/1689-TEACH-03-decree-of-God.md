## Prayer

## The Intro

When God decides something anything at all--especially when it is pertains to us:

- maxed out wisdom
- maxed out love

How God decides, how God ordains, how God decrees is unlike us

- First cause
- Creates creatures, men and angels
- God is not a creature, he is Creator and he creates creatures
- God is the first cause
- God is the first cause of all things
- God's creation--men and angels--are secondary causes
- God's creation--men and angels--sinned against God
- Just because God's creatures sin against God and others, does not mean God is the author of sin
- Satan and Mankind are the originators and the authors of their own sin against God and mankind
- **YET BECAUSE GOD IS SOVEREIGN** God has decreed and ordain all things
- If someone has sinned against us, God has allowed that to happened
- And why would God do that? if he was so powerful and could stop the evil against me, why didn't he stop it? Why didn't he allow it to happen?

## The Decree of God

>Romans 3:25–26 (CSB) God presented him as the mercy seat by his blood, through faith, to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his restraint God passed over the sins previously committed. God presented him to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so that he would be just and justify the one who has faith in Jesus.

All the evils and the sins that his elect has done since Adam and will continued to until the Last Adam comes again--that is, all the sins we have committed **and the sins that have been committed against us**--have been placed upon the crucified Son of Man who bleed for us and died for us because he loved us and gave himself up for us.

God passed over sins previously committed. Why? Because he was going to put all of those sins on his Son--the Messiah and the Savior of the world.

We know this from the Job of the Bible, and every other person in the Bible and in our lives that sin and evil has been done against us and God allowed it to happened.

God did not stop evil from happening. God is fully perfect wisdom and fully perfect love. From this fully perfect stance, he did not stop evil from happening to any of us. That is what we would have done. What God, the Almighty Triune God did was perfectly, lovingly, precisely, fully, truly resolves the problem of evil--

He sent his only begotten Son.

## What God Decrees: the Son of God Is Sent For Us

>Isaiah 46:10 (CSB) I declare the end from the beginning, and from long ago what is not yet done, saying: my plan will take place, and I will do all my will.

>Romans 5:8 (CSB) But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us!

>1 John 4:10 (CSB) Love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins.

>Galatians 2:20 (CSB) I have been crucified with Christ, and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.

>Genesis 3:15 (CSB) I will put hostility between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring. He will strike your head, and you will strike his heel.

>1 John 3:8 (CSB) The one who commits sin is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. The Son of God was revealed for this purpose: to destroy the devil’s works.

## What God Decrees: the Son of God Conquers Evil

### The Death of Christ: Evil has been conquered

>Romans 8:31-37 (CSB) What, then, are we to say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us? He did not even spare his own Son but gave him up for us all. How will he not also with him grant us everything? Who can bring an accusation against God’s elect? God is the one who justifies. Who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is the one who died, but even more, has been raised; he also is at the right hand of God and intercedes for us. Who can separate us from the love of Christ? Can affliction or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? As it is written:  
>Because of you  
>we are being put to death all day long;  
>we are counted as sheep to be slaughtered.  
>No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.

>Revelation 20:11 - 21:11 (CSB) Then I saw a great white throne and one seated on it. Earth and heaven fled from his presence, and no place was found for them. I also saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life, and the dead were judged according to their works by what was written in the books. Then the sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them; each one was judged according to their works. Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.

### The Death of Christ: The People Of God Are With God Forever

>Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. I also saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband.
>
>Then I heard a loud voice from the throne: Look, God’s dwelling is with humanity, and he will live with them. They will be his peoples, and God himself will be with them and will be their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; grief, crying, and pain will be no more, because the previous things have passed away.

### The Death of Christ: Only Answer to the Problem of Evil

>Then the one seated on the throne said, “Look, I am making everything new.” He also said, “Write, because these words are faithful and true.” Then he said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will freely give to the thirsty from the spring of the water of life. The one who conquers will inherit these things, and I will be his God, and he will be my son. But the cowards, faithless, detestable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars — their share will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”
