## The Text

>Matthew 26:26–28 (CSB) As they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, gave it to the disciples, and said, “Take and eat it; this is my body.” Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks, he gave it to them and said, “Drink from it, all of you. For this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.

## The Chapter

**The denial of the cup to the people, worshipping the elements, the lifting them up, or carrying them about for adoration, and reserving them for any pretended religious use, are all contrary to the nature of this ordinance, and to the institution of Christ.**

## The Confession

>Matthew 15:9 (CSB) They worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines human commands.”

>Exodus 20:4–5 (CSB) Do not make an idol for yourself, whether in the shape of anything in the heavens above or on the earth below or in the waters under the earth. Do not bow in worship to them, and do not serve them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, bringing the consequences of the fathers’ iniquity on the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate me,

The argument here is simple: the Lord's Supper is a simple meal for his people. It does not need lots of grandstanding. It is a meal to remember what he has done for us.

>The denial of the cup to the people

At this present time, my local church is going through a church disciplinary issue where, unless the people involved repent of their sin and turn back to Christ, they will be denied communion by the minsters of my church.

This is different from arbitrary denial of communion to people--like a church version of duck, duck, goose. This is not how that works.

To deny the cup and the bread to believers is a gravely serious matter--only when you are in unrepentant sin will you be denied. 

Are you a child of God? Did you corporately repent of yours sins with the rest of the church? You do not have to look inward to see if you are clean. You need to raise your eyss and look upon the Christ who was quicker-than-light forgiven you of all your sins and cleansed you of all unrighteousness.

Take the bread. Take the wine. This is what God has given you--his only begotten Son, Jesus Christ.
