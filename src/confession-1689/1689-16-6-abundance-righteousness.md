## The Text

>Luke 15:21–24 (CSB) The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight. I’m no longer worthy to be called your son.’ <bgy>“But the father told his servants, ‘Quick! Bring out the best robe and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. Then bring the fattened calf and slaughter it, and let’s celebrate with a feast, because this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found!’ So they began to celebrate.</bgy>

## The Chapter

**Yet notwithstanding the persons of believers being accepted through Christ, their good works also are accepted in him; not as though they were in this life wholly unblamable and unreprovable in God’s sight, but that he, looking upon them in his Son, is pleased to accept and reward that which is sincere, although accompanied with many weaknesses and imperfections.**

## The Confession

### The Covering of Christ: Yet notwithstanding the persons of believers being accepted through Christ, their good works also are accepted in him;

>Ephesians 1:5 (CSB) He predestined us to be adopted as sons through Jesus Christ for himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,

>1 Peter 1:5 (CSB) You are being guarded by God’s power through faith for a salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time.

My dearest siblings, it not any good thing that you have done since Christ dwells in you that proves you are saved. The fact that you believe upon the risen Christ, looked upon him, and be saved. The fact that you can do those things? That proves that you are born again.

>1 John 5:1 (CSB) Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father also loves the one born of him.

>1 Corinthians 2:12 (CSB) Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who comes from God, so that we may understand what has been freely given to us by God.

Can you read the Bible and understand that the his word is all about the only begotten Son of God? Can you read the Bible and accept the good news that "Mary has bore a son and we call his name Jesus for he has saved us from our sins"? But you might say, "But I don't understand all of the Bible. There are some things that are too difficult to understand?"

That is true. Look at what Peter says about Paul's writings:

>2 Peter 3:15–16 (CSB) Also, regard the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our dear brother Paul has written to you according to the wisdom given to him. He speaks about these things in all his letters. There are some matters that are hard to understand. The untaught and unstable will twist them to their own destruction, as they also do with the rest of the Scriptures.

There are some matters that are hard to understand--that is true. But what is clear--Jesus has saved us from our sins. You understand that. You believe that. You have been born again.

NOW, because you have born again, guess what? You are a son of God. You are his adopted child. You are co-heir with the Son who has inherited everything. 

Our Blessed Father is Creator of the Universe. To say he owns the cattle on a thousands hills is an understatement of a lifetime. But it is true. And our Eldest Brother is the King of king and Lord of lords. And the exact same Spirit that raised Christ from the dead has raised you from death unto life and now dwells in you.

Now what? What are going to do about it?

>Ephesians 2:10 (CSB) For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared ahead of time for us to do.

>1 Corinthians 3:9 (CSB) For we are God’s coworkers. You are God’s field, God’s building.

Don't serve God. He needs nothing from us. He is not served by human hands. What did Christ say? Loving your neighbor is the same as loving God. 

>Matthew 22:36-40 (CSB) “Teacher, which command in the law is the greatest? ” He said to him, “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the greatest and most important command. <bgy>The second is like it</bgy>: Love your neighbor as yourself. All the Law and the Prophets depend on these two commands.”

Now you get to go do good things and those things are pleasing to God because you are in Christ and Christ is in you and the Father has said it multiple times over, "This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased."

That's you because you are in Christ. Go and love others.

### The Covering of Christ: not as though they were in this life wholly unblamable and unreprovable in God’s sight, but that he, looking upon them in his Son, is pleased to accept and reward that which is sincere, although accompanied with many weaknesses and imperfections.

>Matthew 25:21 (CSB) “His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You were faithful over a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Share your master’s joy.’

>Matthew 25:23 (CSB) “His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You were faithful over a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Share your master’s joy.’

>Hebrews 6:10 (CSB) For God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you demonstrated for his name by serving the saints—and by continuing to serve them.

Listen to me. What I have to say doesn't pertain to unbelievers--they do not believe the good news because they are dead in their trespasses and sins. That cannot believe because they do not possess the Triune God.

I speak to those Christians who would flat out deny the perfect atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. So many in church want to take away the sting of the death of the Son of God. They would say, "God can simply forgive sins. Jesus did it while he was walking the earth. Christ did not have to die. Christ was the mere victim of circumstance. He died for an unjust cause."

To those Christian, let me ask, why are you giving me bad news? From the bottom of my heart, I say this in love, you are giving me the worst news I have ever heard.

It is so convincing that God can forgive sins by merely speaking the words. As though our God is some sort of a magician and says, "hocus pocus." I would believe that bad news if it was not for the word of God:

>Hebrews 9:22 (CSB) According to the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.

The harsh reality is that we have all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. In the Old Testament, God gave the command of sacrificing animals to cover the sins of the people. Even followed to the letter, the blood of animals was not the thing that took away sins. It was a foreshadowing of the perfect sacrifice of the Son of God.

>Hebrews 10:4 (CSB) For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.

Everything that God did prior to the revealing of the Messiah was a foreshadow of what would it take to wash away the sins of his people.

>Romans 3:21-26 (CSB) But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed, attested by the Law and the Prophets. The righteousness of God is through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe, since there is no distinction. For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. They are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. God presented him as an atoning sacrifice in his blood, received through faith, to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his restraint God passed over the sins previously committed. God presented him to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so that he would be righteous and declare righteous the one who has faith in Jesus.

>John 12:32-33 (CSB) As for me, if I am lifted up from the earth I will draw all people to myself.” He said this to indicate what kind of death he was about to die.

And

>John 3:14-15 (CSB) “Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.

It is not the mere words of God that forgives sins. The Almighty Creator of heaven and hell put on full display his glory in giving his only begotten Son within the confines of the history of mankind. Not even the most ignorant fool could deny the historical life, death, resurrection, and ascension of the Lord Jesus Christ. And it was in the promises of God and satisfaction of God by the Son of God that washed away the sins of his people.

>Because the sinless Savior died,
>My sinful soul is counted free;
>For God, the Just, is satisfied
>To look on Him and pardon me.
