## The Chapter

### God gave to Adam a law of universal obedience written in his heart, and a particular precept of not eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil; by which he bound him and all his posterity to personal, entire, exact, and perpetual obedience; promised life upon the fulfilling, and threatened death upon the breach of it, and endued him with power and ability to keep it.

## The Confession

### God gave to Adam a law of universal obedience written in his heart, and a particular precept of not eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil

>Genesis 1:27 (CSB) So God created man in his own image; he created him in the image of God; he created them male and female.

>Ecclesiastes 7:29 (CSB) Only see this: I have discovered that God made people upright, but they pursued many schemes.”

### by which he bound him and all his posterity to personal, entire, exact, and perpetual obedience

>Romans 10:5 (CSB) since Moses writes about the righteousness that is from the law: The one who does these things will live by them.

### promised life upon the fulfilling, and threatened death upon the breach of it, and endued him with power and ability to keep it

>Galatians 3:10–12 (CSB) For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, because it is written, Everyone who does not do everything written in the book of the law is cursed. Now it is clear that no one is justified before God by the law, because the righteous will live by faith. But the law is not based on faith; instead, the one who does these things will live by them.
