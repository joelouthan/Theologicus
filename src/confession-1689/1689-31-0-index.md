## [31.1 Made From Dust: Return to Dust](1689-31-1-made-from-dust-return-to-dust.md)

The bodies of men after death return to dust, and see corruption; but their souls, which neither die nor sleep, having an immortal subsistence, immediately return to God who gave them. The souls of the righteous being then made perfect in holiness, are received into paradise, where they are with Christ, and behold the face of God in light and glory, waiting for the full redemption of their bodies; and the souls of the wicked are cast into hell; where they remain in torment and utter darkness, reserved to the judgment of the great day; besides these two places, for souls separated from their bodies, the Scripture acknowledgeth none.

>Genesis 3:19 (CSB) You will eat bread by the sweat of your brow until you return to the ground, since you were taken from it. For you are dust, and you will return to dust.”

>Acts 13:36 (CSB) For David, after serving God’s purpose in his own generation, fell asleep, was buried with his fathers, and decayed,

>Ecclesiastes 12:7 (CSB) and the dust returns to the earth as it once was, and the spirit returns to God who gave it.

>Luke 23:43 (CSB) And he said to him, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise.”

>2 Corinthians 5:1–8 (CSB) For we know that if our earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal dwelling in the heavens, not made with hands. Indeed, we groan in this tent, desiring to put on our heavenly dwelling, since, when we are clothed, we will not be found naked. Indeed, we groan while we are in this tent, burdened as we are, because we do not want to be unclothed but clothed, so that mortality may be swallowed up by life. Now the one who prepared us for this very purpose is God, who gave us the Spirit as a down payment. So we are always confident and know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord. For we walk by faith, not by sight. In fact, we are confident, and we would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord.

>Philippians 1:23 (CSB) I am torn between the two. I long to depart and be with Christ—which is far better—

>Hebrews 12:23 (CSB) to the assembly of the firstborn whose names have been written in heaven, to a Judge, who is God of all, to the spirits of righteous people made perfect,

>Jude 6–7 (CSB) and the angels who did not keep their own position but abandoned their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains in deep darkness for the judgment on the great day. Likewise, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns committed sexual immorality and perversions, and serve as an example by undergoing the punishment of eternal fire.

>1 Peter 3:19 (CSB) in which he also went and made proclamation to the spirits in prison

>Luke 16:23–24 (CSB) And being in torment in Hades, he looked up and saw Abraham a long way off, with Lazarus at his side. ‘Father Abraham!’ he called out, ‘Have mercy on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this flame!’

## [31.2 Made From Dust: Raised to God](1689-31-2-made-from-dust-raised-to-god.md)

At the last day, such of the saints as are found alive, shall not sleep, but be changed; and all the dead shall be raised up with the selfsame bodies, and none other; although with different qualities, which shall be united again to their souls forever.

>1 Corinthians 15:51–52 (CSB) Listen, I am telling you a mystery: We will not all fall asleep, but we will all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed.

>1 Thessalonians 4:17 (CSB) Then we who are still alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord.

>Job 19:26–27 (CSB) Even after my skin has been destroyed, yet I will see God in my flesh. I will see him myself; my eyes will look at him, and not as a stranger. My heart longs within me.

>1 Corinthians 15:42–43 (CSB) So it is with the resurrection of the dead: Sown in corruption, raised in incorruption; sown in dishonor, raised in glory; sown in weakness, raised in power;

## [31.3 Made From Dust: Glorified By God](1689-31-3-made-from-dust-glorified-by-god.md)

The bodies of the unjust shall, by the power of Christ, be raised to dishonour; the bodies of the just, by his Spirit, unto honour, and be made conformable to his own glorious body.

>Acts 24:15 (CSB) I have a hope in God, which these men themselves also accept, that there will be a resurrection, both of the righteous and the unrighteous.

>John 5:28–29 (CSB) Do not be amazed at this, because a time is coming when all who are in the graves will hear his voice and come out—those who have done good things, to the resurrection of life, but those who have done wicked things, to the resurrection of condemnation.

>Philippians 3:21 (CSB) He will transform the body of our humble condition into the likeness of his glorious body, by the power that enables him to subject everything to himself.
