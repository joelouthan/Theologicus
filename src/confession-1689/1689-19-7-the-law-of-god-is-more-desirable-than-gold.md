## The Text

>Psalms 19:10-11 (CSB)  
>They are more desirable than gold —  
>than an abundance of pure gold;  
>and sweeter than honey  
>dripping from a honeycomb.  
>In addition, your servant is warned by them,  
>and in keeping them there is an abundant reward.

## The Chapter

**Neither are the aforementioned uses of the law contrary to the grace of the Gospel, but do sweetly comply with it, the Spirit of Christ subduing and enabling the will of man to do that freely and cheerfully which the will of God, revealed in the law, requireth to be done.**

## The Confession

### Neither are the aforementioned uses of the law contrary to the grace of the Gospel, but do sweetly comply with it

>Galatians 3:21 (CSB) Is the law therefore contrary to God’s promises? Absolutely not! For if the law had been granted with the ability to give life, then righteousness would certainly be on the basis of the law.

### the Spirit of Christ subduing and enabling the will of man to do that freely and cheerfully which the will of God, revealed in the law, requireth to be done

>Ezekiel 36:27 (CSB) I will place my Spirit within you and cause you to follow my statutes and carefully observe my ordinances.
