## The Chapter

**The moral law doth for ever bind all, as well justified persons as others, to the obedience thereof, and that not only in regard of the matter contained in it, but also in respect of the authority of God the Creator, who gave it; neither doth Christ in the Gospel any way dissolve, but much strengthen this obligation.**

## The Confession

### The moral law does for ever bind all, as well justified persons as others, to the obedience thereof

>Romans 13:8–10 (CSB) Do not owe anyone anything, except to love one another, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law. The commandments, Do not commit adultery; do not murder; do not steal; do not covet; and any other commandment, are summed up by this commandment: Love your neighbor as yourself. Love does no wrong to a neighbor. Love, therefore, is the fulfillment of the law.

>James 2:8–12 (CSB) Indeed, if you fulfill the royal law prescribed in the Scripture, Love your neighbor as yourself, you are doing well. If, however, you show favoritism, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors. For whoever keeps the entire law, and yet stumbles at one point, is guilty of breaking it all. For he who said, Do not commit adultery, also said, Do not murder. So if you do not commit adultery, but you murder, you are a lawbreaker. Speak and act as those who are to be judged by the law of freedom.

### and that not only in regard of the matter contained in it, but also in respect of the authority of God the Creator, who gave it

>James 2:10–11 (CSB) For whoever keeps the entire law, and yet stumbles at one point, is guilty of breaking it all. For he who said, Do not commit adultery, also said, Do not murder. So if you do not commit adultery, but you murder, you are a lawbreaker.

### neither does Christ in the Gospel any way dissolve, but much strengthen this obligation

>Matthew 5:17–19 (CSB) “Don’t think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to abolish but to fulfill. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or one stroke of a letter will pass away from the law until all things are accomplished. Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commands and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever does and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

>Romans 3:31 (CSB) Do we then nullify the law through faith? Absolutely not! On the contrary, we uphold the law.

Let me take it even further:

>Romans 6:1-3 (CSB) What should we say then? Should we continue in sin so that grace may multiply? Absolutely not! How can we who died to sin still live in it? Or are you unaware that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?

And

>Romans 6:6-7 (CSB) For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be rendered powerless so that we may no longer be enslaved to sin, since a person who has died is freed from sin.

Based on:

>Matthew 5:19 (CSB) Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commands and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever does and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

Christ has fulfilled the law by fulfilling what the law demands: obey God. He is our obedience.

But for what God has done does not some way allow any of us to break the law of God. Or as my oldest son likes to put, "Just out here wyldin' out." No!

People who see that Christ has done it all, what are we to do?

>Ephesians 2:8-10 (CSB) For you are saved by grace through faith, and this is not from yourselves; it is God’s gift— not from works, so that no one can boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared ahead of time for us to do.

Beloved, you and I are created--born again in Christ Jesus for good works, which God has prepared ahead of time for us to do. Listen, Acts 17 says he determines in what times we are to live in and the lands where we live. If he determines that, what are we then to do? Acts 17 also says we don't serve God because God does not need anything from us because he is not served by human hands.

Love one another.

>John 13:34-35 (CSB) “I give you a new command: Love one another. Just as I have loved you, you are also to love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.”

>Matt 22:37-40 (CSB) He said to him, “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the greatest and most important command. The second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself. All the Law and the Prophets depend on these two commands.”

Emphasis on that one point: "**The second is like it.**" In Matthew's Gospel, Christ equates to the first and second commandment.

So what are we to do? Love your neighbor because you love God. Wanna love God? Love your neighbor. And we know from Christ's teaching on "Who is our neighbor?" from the parable of the Good Samaritan, that our neighbor is everyone.

You have been born again. Now, you *get* to obey God.

>Ezekiel 36:25-27 (CSB) I will also sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your impurities and all your idols. I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will remove your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. I will place my Spirit within you and cause you to follow my statutes and carefully observe my ordinances.
