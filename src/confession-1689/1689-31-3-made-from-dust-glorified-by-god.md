**The bodies of the unjust shall, by the power of Christ, be raised to dishonour; the bodies of the just, by his Spirit, unto honour, and be made conformable to his own glorious body.**

## The Confession

>Acts 24:15 (CSB) I have a hope in God, which these men themselves also accept, that there will be a resurrection, both of the righteous and the unrighteous.

>John 5:28–29 (CSB) Do not be amazed at this, because a time is coming when all who are in the graves will hear his voice and come out—those who have done good things, to the resurrection of life, but those who have done wicked things, to the resurrection of condemnation.

>Philippians 3:21 (CSB) He will transform the body of our humble condition into the likeness of his glorious body, by the power that enables him to subject everything to himself.
