## The Text

>Psalm 16:10–11 (CSB) For you will not abandon me to Sheol; you will not allow your faithful one to see decay. You reveal the path of life to me; in your presence is abundant joy; at your right hand are eternal pleasures.

>Psalm 17:15 (CSB) But I will see your face in righteousness; when I awake, I will be satisfied with your presence.

## The Chapter

**The bodies of the unjust shall, by the power of Christ, be raised to dishonour; the bodies of the just, by his Spirit, unto honour, and be made conformable to his own glorious body.**

## The Confession

>Acts 24:15 (CSB) I have a hope in God, which these men themselves also accept, that there will be a resurrection, both of the righteous and the unrighteous.

>John 5:28–29 (CSB) Do not be amazed at this, because a time is coming when all who are in the graves will hear his voice and come out—those who have done good things, to the resurrection of life, but those who have done wicked things, to the resurrection of condemnation.

>Philippians 3:21 (CSB) He will transform the body of our humble condition into the likeness of his glorious body, by the power that enables him to subject everything to himself.

There are two destinations for the imagebearers of God: either with God or under his wrath. One quote comes to mind, "There are infinite ways to get to God but only one path that is under the protection from the wrath of God, that can only be found in Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior."

So you see, death is either the first or last point of pain. First for unbelievers as they are stay under the wrath of God for their sins against God. Or last for the believers as they are finally called home to be with their Father.

>We are more than conquerors through his grace who loved us in the very circumstances that threaten to overwhelm. Fear not, then, the darkest cloud, nor the proudest waves, nor the deepest needs- in these very things you shall, through Christ, prove triumphant. Nor shrink from the battle with the "last enemy." Death received a death-wound when Christ died. You face a conquered foe. He stands at your side a crownless king, and waving a broken scepter. Your death shall be another victory over the believer's last foe. Planting your foot of faith upon his prostrate neck, you shall spring into glory, more than a conqueror, through him that loved you. Thus passing to glory in triumph, you shall go to swell the ranks of the "noble army of martyrs"- those Christian heroes of whom it is recorded, "THEY OVERCAME HIM BY THE BLOOD Of THE LAMB."

And then, for the believer, we will have the fullness of joy--unlimited pure real joy because we will be with our God and Savior.

We will pleasures forevermore--unending bliss. Our souls will not be corrupted by sin but rather perfectly satisfied by beholding the face of our Jesus.

That's the end goal, the finish line, the prize, the crown, the end game: get to Jesus.

You don't think you are strong enough? No worries. It is not on yours or my feeble strength. For it is the Almighty God in his great gospel that will bring us all the way home for the glory of his name and our joy forevermore.

Amen.
