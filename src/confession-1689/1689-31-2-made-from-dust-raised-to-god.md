## The Text

>1 Corinthians 15:51–52 Listen, I am telling you a mystery: We will not all fall asleep, but we will all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed.

## The Chapter

**At the last day, such of the saints as are found alive, shall not sleep, but be changed; and all the dead shall be raised up with the selfsame bodies, and none other; although with different qualities, which shall be united again to their souls forever.**

## The Confession

### At the last day, such of the saints as are found alive, shall not sleep, but be changed

>1 Thessalonians 4:17 Then we who are still alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord.

### and all the dead shall be raised up with the selfsame bodies, and none other

>Job 19:26–27 Even after my skin has been destroyed, yet I will see God in my flesh. I will see him myself; my eyes will look at him, and not as a stranger. My heart longs within me.

### although with different qualities, which shall be united again to their souls forever

>1 Corinthians 15:42–43 So it is with the resurrection of the dead: Sown in corruption, raised in incorruption; sown in dishonor, raised in glory; sown in weakness, raised in power;

Look:

>Romans 8:11 And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, then he who raised Christ from the dead will also bring your mortal bodies to life through his Spirit who lives in you.

Our souls will meet with God. Then God will resurrect our bodies, recreate them and join them back to our souls. We will not just be some ghosts floating around. God created us whole beings--soul, mind, will, heart, and body.

We are to love God with everything we got. Now that we have died and joined with him, we get to love him with everything we got--now perfectly and without sin. Forever.
