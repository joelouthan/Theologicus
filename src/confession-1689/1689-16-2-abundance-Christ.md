## The Chapter

**These good works, done in obedience to God’s commandments, are the fruits and evidences of a true and lively faith; and by them believers manifest their thankfulness, strengthen their assurance, edify their brethren, adorn the profession of the gospel, stop the mouths of the adversaries, and glorify God, whose workmanship they are, created in Christ Jesus thereunto, that having their fruit unto holiness they may have the end eternal life.**

## The Confession

### Only Christ is Good: These good works, done in obedience to God’s commandments, are the fruits and evidences of a true and lively faith;

>James 2:18 (CSB) But someone will say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without works, and I will show you faith by my works.

By no means that doing good works makes one saved unto God. Keep this in mind: those who are willfully disobedient to God are not of God. And yes, I am aware that because of our fallen natures, we are judgmental towards others not ourselves and think, "Yes, those people who sin continuously and call themselves Christian when they are not."

But when the morally good does good things, we often fall in the trap of "I am good because I am doing good things." But here are big facts: you obeying God and doing the works which he alone can deemed good is actual fruit of the indwelling of God in you. Can you do good deeds to serve your neighbor? Can you love your enemy? If you answer yes, then that is the work of God in you.

>Matthew 7:17–18 (CSB) In the same way, every good tree produces good fruit, but a bad tree produces bad fruit. A good tree can’t produce bad fruit; neither can a bad tree produce good fruit.

### Only Christ is Good: and by them believers manifest their thankfulness,

>Psalm 116:12–13 (CSB) How can I repay the LORD for all the good he has done for me? I will take the cup of salvation and call on the name of the LORD.

This, in turn, gives an heart of worship to God and give thanks for what he has done in you. Ezekiel 36 says it best: God has given you a new heart--his heart. Now you have new desires--desires for him and to worship him.

>Romans 1:18 (CSB) For God’s wrath is revealed from heaven against all godlessness and unrighteousness of people who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth,

And.

>Romans 1:21–23 (CSB) For though they knew God, they did not glorify him as God or show gratitude. Instead, their thinking became worthless, and their senseless hearts were darkened. Claiming to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man, birds, four-footed animals, and reptiles.

And.

>Jeremiah 17:9 (CSB) The heart is more deceitful than anything else, and incurable — who can understand it?

Because we were born children of God, we have all exchanged the glory of God for the glory of ourselves. We have exchanged the right worship of the One True God to worship, adore, focus, fixed, navel-gazed, and internalize unto ourselves. But then God, only good, merciful, and lovely, looks upon your wicked heart, pulls it out and replaces it with his own.

### Only Christ is Good: strengthen their assurance

>1 John 2:3 (CSB) This is how we know that we know him: if we keep his commands.

>1 John 2:5 (CSB) But whoever keeps his word, truly in him the love of God is made complete. This is how we know we are in him:

>2 Peter 1:5–11 (CSB) For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with goodness, goodness with knowledge, knowledge with self-control, self-control with endurance, endurance with godliness, godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love. For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being useless or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. The person who lacks these things is blind and shortsighted and has forgotten the cleansing from his past sins. Therefore, brothers and sisters, make every effort to confirm your calling and election, because if you do these things you will never stumble. For in this way, entry into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly provided for you.

And you are going to see this in your life, maybe not day to day, but more "one degree of glory to another." If you stay fixed on yourself to try to determined if Christ is in you, then you will always miss it. But look back on your lifetime and see that God was always doing the work, always giving the growth, always willfully bringing you to maturity, discipling you and conforming you to the image of his Son.

### Only Christ is Good: edify their brethren, adorn the profession of the gospel

>Matthew 5:16 (CSB) In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.

And this is true prophesy: that we preach the gospel of Christ to every creature to the ends of the earth because Christ is with you till the end of the age. (Mark 16:15, Matthew 28:20)

### Only Christ is Good: stop the mouths of the adversaries, and glorify God

>1 Timothy 6:1 (CSB) All who are under the yoke as slaves should regard their own masters as worthy of all respect, so that God’s name and his teaching will not be blasphemed.

>1 Peter 2:15 (CSB) For it is God’s will that you silence the ignorance of foolish people by doing good.

>Philippians 1:11 (CSB) filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God.

And the right prophesy of what Christ has done will always silence the mouths of the adversaries--that those who would unload unspeakable burdens upon you that you cannot bear, Christ was sent to save us from our sins.

>Matthew 11:28-30 (CSB) “Come to me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take up my yoke and learn from me, because I am lowly and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”

All the legalism and carnal wickedness will seek to destroy us. Christ has come to give us his righteousness so that can be saved unto God forever. And this is completely based on what Christ has done--not what we have done.

### Only Christ is Good: whose workmanship they are, created in Christ Jesus thereunto

>Ephesians 2:8–10 (CSB) For you are saved by grace through faith, and this is not from yourselves; it is God’s gift—not from works, so that no one can boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared ahead of time for us to do.

Look at what God has given you: salvation, grace, and faith. Now we have nothing to boast about but we get to worship God alone! We get to shower him with praise and thanksgiving.

And we need not to give God anything for he needs nothing and is not served by human hands. (Acts 17:25) All of the good works that you are to do have been ordained by God for you to do. But what is the purpose of these good works?

>Matthew 22:37-40 (CSB) He said to him, “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the greatest and most important command. The second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself. All the Law and the Prophets depend on these two commands.”

Go, love your neighbor as yourself.

### Only Christ is Good: that having their fruit unto holiness they may have the end eternal life

>Romans 6:22 (CSB) But now, since you have been set free from sin and have become enslaved to God, you have your fruit, which results in sanctification—and the outcome is eternal life!

We will never be perfect on this side of heaven. Our glory by God is given to us by God when we see God face to face. But while we are on this earth, we are forever secured unto God because everything that Christ did to save us from our sins is completed and perfectly--once and for all.

We have the Christ. Praise his holy name!
