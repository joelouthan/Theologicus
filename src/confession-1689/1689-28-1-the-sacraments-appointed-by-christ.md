## The Text

>Matthew 28:19–20 (CSB) Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe everything I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”

>1 Corinthians 11:26 (CSB) For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.

## The Chapter

**Baptism and the Lord's Supper are ordinances of positive and sovereign institution, appointed by the Lord Jesus, the only lawgiver, to be continued in his church to the end of the world.**

## The Confession

Get on social media, especially boards like Reddit, filled with anonymous users, and on the subject of church, they will be quick to give their opinion on what the church ought to do.

"Be more inclusive!" "Females need to be pastors." "Feed and care for the poor." Do more of the things that world thinks to be doing.

Will you come to church? Not necessarily.

A study of Scripture would informed the reader that the church is about three things only. The world wants the church to do certain things. Heck, believers have their own preferences and will let you know what the church should be doing.

But what does the church do?

Preach Christ and him crucified:

>1 Corinthians 1:21–23 (CSB) For since, in God’s wisdom, the world did not know God through wisdom, God was pleased to save those who believe through the foolishness of what is preached. For the Jews ask for signs and the Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to the Jews and foolishness to the Gentiles.

The world wants us to do these things. Other good intended believers want us to do certain things. But minister are called to preached the word of God.

And I said there were three things total. Here are the other two:

Baptize:

>Matthew 28:19–20 (CSB) Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe everything I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”

Communion:

>1 Corinthians 11:26 (CSB) For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.

Too simple? Maybe. But these are the command of Christ for his church. 

These three things--preaching, baptizing, and giving communion--if we do these three things, then this will break down the gates of hell.

Too simple? Because it is in our natural born hearts that it is not enough. From the garden, we want to add more onto what God says so it feels better to us. But God is perfect and what he gives is perfect and what he says is perfect and what he does is perfect.

Do these things, church, and you will see the gates of Hades fall like the walls of Jericho.
