## The Text

>Matthew 4:4 (CSB) He answered, “It is written: Man must not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.”

## The Chapter

**This promise of Christ, and salvation by him, is revealed only by the Word of God; neither do the works of creation or providence, with the light of nature, make discovery of Christ, or of grace by him, so much as in a general or obscure way; much less that men destitute of the revelation of Him by the promise or gospel, should be enabled thereby to attain saving faith or repentance.**

## The Confession

Within the last ten years or so, there are have been murmurings of those in the Middle East being called to salvation by what appears to be the Christ in their dreams. I say "murmurings" because I have never heard any more than, "Did you hear about those in the Middle East seeing Jesus in their dreams and being saved?" And that's it. That is the end of that. Nothing more in detail from that point on.

As Dr. Renihan so aptly noted that this particular chapter in the confession is not defining the gospel *per se* but rather how is the gospel reaches all the peoples to the four corners of the earth.[^1] I mention Christ appearing in dreams and visions to the people living the Middle East could be a possibility. But unless that dream and vision points to the gospel revealed in the Word of God *alone* then it is all for not.

>Acts 4:12 (CSB) There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to people by which we must be saved.

And

>Galatians 1:8-9 (CSB) But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, a curse be on him! As we have said before, I now say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, a curse be on him!

### This promise of Christ, and salvation by him, is revealed only by the Word of God

>Romans 1:17 (CSB) For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, just as it is written: The righteous will live by faith.

In theology proper, what we know of God is defined in two ways: general and special revelation.

**General Revelation** - what we know of God can be found in this creation. This is available to all people of all times.

>Romans 1:18-20 (CSB) For God’s wrath is revealed from heaven against all godlessness and unrighteousness of people who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth, since what can be known about God is evident among them, because God has shown it to them. For his invisible attributes, that is, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen since the creation of the world, being understood through what he has made. As a result, people are without excuse.

And even the common grace of God to everyone, believers and unbelievers alike:

>Matthew 5:45 (CSB) so that you may be children of your Father in heaven. For he causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.

### neither do the works of creation or providence, with the light of nature, make discovery of Christ, or of grace by him, so much as in a general or obscure way

To that end, by general revelation, mankind would not know who God is. We all have a sense of there is a God, that He is powerful, and even within his existence, we must fear him. But those feelings and thoughts alone do not save us. We need to know who God is and what He has done for us. And that is only revealed in special revelation.

**Special Revelation** - Who God is and what he has done for us that is revealed in the canonical sixty-six books of the Bible by the work of the Spirit alone.

>Romans 10:14–17 (CSB) How, then, can they call on him they have not believed in? And how can they believe without hearing about him? And how can they hear without a preacher? And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news. But not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our message? So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the message about Christ.

And

>1 Corinthians 2:12 (CSB) Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who comes from God, so that we may understand what has been freely given to us by God.

The last portion, *by the Spirit alone*, is critical especially given our post-Enlightment, Modern and Post-Modern era. Let me be completely frank. Even if a person, born in a Christian home, attended church all of their lives, attended the finest Christian schools, attended the best Bible colleges, graduated from the most theologically conservative seminaries with perfect marks, served as a pastor for all of their lives, and wrote the most theologically sound books, if the Spirit has not done his work in that person's heart by the grace and mercy of God through the life and death of Christ, then that person will not entered into the kingdom of God.

>John 3:3 (CSB) Jesus replied, “Truly I tell you, unless someone is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”

### much less that men destitute of the revelation of Him by the promise or gospel, should be enabled thereby to attain saving faith or repentance

>Proverbs 29:18 (CSB) Without revelation people run wild, but one who follows divine instruction will be happy.

>Isaiah 25:7 (CSB) On this mountain he will swallow up the burial shroud, the shroud over all the peoples, the sheet covering all the nations.

>Isaiah 60:2–3 (CSB) For look, darkness will cover the earth, and total darkness the peoples; but the LORD will shine over you, and his glory will appear over you. Nations will come to your light, and kings to your shining brightness.

All humans, all of born of Adam, inheriting Adam's sin, are born into darkness. All of the prestige, lineage, upbringing, schooling, learning in the world will not bring a person one micron closer into the saving arms of the Father.

We cannot earn our salvation. What in the world makes us think we could *learn* our way into the kingdom.

>1 Corinthians 1:18 (CSB) For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but it is God’s power to us who are being saved.

This is the gospel: by perfect obedience of Christ, and from the grace and mercies of the Father, the Spirit must quicken our dead corpse, exchange our heart of stone for the soft heart of God, open our eyes, open our ears, unmute our tongue, renew our mind, and the entire Triune God must dwell within us for us to be saved to God by God for God.

Nothing that we have ever done, even perhaps have a soft heart for the things of God or even been revealed in a dream, will first save us. God must first save us.

>Romans 1:16–17 (CSB) For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, just as it is written: The righteous will live by faith.
