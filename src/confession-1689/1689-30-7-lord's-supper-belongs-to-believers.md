## The Text

>1 Corinthians 10:16 (CSB) The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a sharing in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a sharing in the body of Christ?

## The Chapter

**Worthy receivers, outwardly partaking of the visible elements in this ordinance, do then also inwardly by faith, really and indeed, yet not carnally and corporally, but spiritually receive, and feed upon Christ crucified, and all the benefits of his death; the body and blood of Christ being then not corporally or carnally, but spiritually present to the faith of believers in that ordinance, as the elements themselves are to their outward senses.**

## The Confession

>1 Corinthians 11:23–26 (CSB) For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: On the night when he was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, broke it, and said, “This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, and said, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.

We are the sons of God! We believe and trust in his only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior!

We get to partake in the Lord's Supper! He is with us and he is for us! We have no condemnation because we are in the Christ. We have no accuser because God is for us!

This meal is real. We get to behold the face of his precious Son!

Worship and glorify his holy name! Jesus Christ!

Amen.
