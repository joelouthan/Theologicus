## The Text

>John 19:19-22 Pilate also had a sign made and put on the cross. It said: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. Many of the Jews read this sign, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Aramaic, Latin, and Greek. So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Don’t write, ‘The king of the Jews,’ but that he said, ‘I am the king of the Jews.’ ”
Pilate replied, “What I have written, I have written.”

## The Chapter

**This number and order of offices is necessary; for in respect of our ignorance, we stand in need of his prophetical office; and in respect of our alienation from God, and imperfection of the best of our services, we need his priestly office to reconcile us and present us acceptable unto God; and in respect to our averseness and utter inability to return to God, and for our rescue and security from our spiritual adversaries, we need his kingly office to convince, subdue, draw, uphold, deliver, and preserve us to his heavenly kingdom.**

## The Confession

### This number and order of offices is necessary; for in respect of our ignorance, we stand in need of His prophetical office

>John 1:18 No one has ever seen God. The one and only Son, who is himself God and is at the Father’s side—he has revealed him.

### and in respect of our alienation from God, and imperfection of the best of our services, we need His priestly office to reconcile us and present us acceptable unto God

>Colossians 1:21 Once you were alienated and hostile in your minds as expressed in your evil actions.

>Galatians 5:17 For the flesh desires what is against the Spirit, and the Spirit desires what is against the flesh; these are opposed to each other, so that you don’t do what you want.

### and in respect to our averseness and utter inability to return to God, and for our rescue and security from our spiritual adversaries, we need His kingly office to convince, subdue, draw, uphold, deliver, and preserve us to His heavenly kingdom

>John 16:8 When he comes, he will convict the world about sin, righteousness, and judgment:

>Psalm 110:3 Your people will volunteer on your day of battle. In holy splendor, from the womb of the dawn, the dew of your youth belongs to you.

>Luke 1:74–75 since we have been rescued from the hand of our enemies, to serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness in his presence all our days.
