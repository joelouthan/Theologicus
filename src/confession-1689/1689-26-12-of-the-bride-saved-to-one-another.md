## The Text

## The Chapter

**As all believers are bound to join themselves to particular churches, when and where they have opportunity so to do; so all that are admitted unto the privileges of a church, are also under the censures and government thereof, according to the rule of Christ.**

TODO: the adopted children of God being pulled together to the local church and thus receiving 100% of all his benefits 

>Psalms 103:1-5 (CSB) My soul, bless the LORD,  
>and all that is within me, bless his holy name.  
>My soul, bless the LORD,  
>and do not forget all his benefits.  
>He forgives all your iniquity;  
>he heals all your diseases.  
>He redeems your life from the Pit;  
>he crowns you with faithful love and compassion.  
>He satisfies you with good things;  
>your youth is renewed like the eagle.

## The Confession

>1 Thessalonians 5:14 (CSB) And we exhort you, brothers and sisters: warn those who are idle, comfort the discouraged, help the weak, be patient with everyone.

>2 Thessalonians 3:6–15 (CSB) Now we command you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to keep away from every brother or sister who is idle and does not live according to the tradition received from us. For you yourselves know how you should imitate us: We were not idle among you; we did not eat anyone’s food free of charge; instead, we labored and toiled, working night and day, so that we would not be a burden to any of you. It is not that we don’t have the right to support, but we did it to make ourselves an example to you so that you would imitate us. In fact, when we were with you, this is what we commanded you: “If anyone isn’t willing to work, he should not eat.” For we hear that there are some among you who are idle. They are not busy but busybodies. Now we command and exhort such people by the Lord Jesus Christ to work quietly and provide for themselves. But as for you, brothers and sisters, do not grow weary in doing good. If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take note of that person; don’t associate with him, so that he may be ashamed. Yet don’t consider him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.
