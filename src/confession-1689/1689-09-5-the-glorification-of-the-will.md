## The Confession

>Ephesians 4:13 (CSB) until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of God’s Son, growing into maturity with a stature measured by Christ’s fullness.

From the beginning, God worked six days to create the heavens and the earth. On the sixth day, he created mankind, male and female, in his image. The seventh day of God that he marked as the Sabbath which is holy and restful was the first day of life for Adam and Eve. 

We started off in resting in the Lord. Sin marred and messed it up so bad that work works against us and we have no rest.

But Christ came. He worked so we could rest in him. And one day, we will get to perfectly, finally, definitely rest all because of what God has done for us in Christ.

>Romans 8:30 (CSB) And those he predestined, he also called; and those he called, he also justified; and those he justified, he also glorified.

Our final Sabbath is coming, brothers and sisters. Rest in his amazing grace.

Amen.
