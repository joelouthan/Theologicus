## The Text

>Ephesians 4:11-16 (CSB) And he himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, to build up the body of Christ, until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of God’s Son, growing into maturity with a stature measured by Christ’s fullness. Then we will no longer be little children, tossed by the waves and blown around by every wind of teaching, by human cunning with cleverness in the techniques of deceit. But speaking the truth in love, let us grow in every way into him who is the head — Christ. From him the whole body, fitted and knit together by every supporting ligament, promotes the growth of the body for building itself up in love by the proper working of each individual part.

## The Chapter

**In cases of difficulties or differences, either in point of doctrine or administration, wherein either the churches in general are concerned, or any one church, in their peace, union, and edification; or any member or members of any church are injured, in or by any proceedings in censures not agreeable to truth and order: it is according to the mind of Christ, that many churches holding communion together, do, by their messengers, meet to consider, and give their advice in or about that matter in difference, to be reported to all the churches concerned; howbeit these messengers assembled, are not intrusted with any church-power properly so called; or with any jurisdiction over the churches themselves, to exercise any censures either over any churches or persons; or to impose their determination on the churches or officers.**

## The Confession

### In cases of difficulties or differences, either in point of doctrine or administration, wherein either the churches in general are concerned, or any one church, in their peace, union, and edification; or any member or members of any church are injured, in or by any proceedings in censures not agreeable to truth and order: it is according to the mind of Christ, that many churches holding communion together, do, by their messengers, meet to consider, and give their advice in or about that matter in difference, to be reported to all the churches concerned

>2 Corinthians 8:18–24 (CSB) We have sent with him the brother who is praised among all the churches for his gospel ministry. And not only that, but he was also appointed by the churches to accompany us with this gracious gift that we are administering for the glory of the Lord himself and to show our eagerness to help. We are taking this precaution so that no one will criticize us about this large sum that we are administering. Indeed, we are giving careful thought to do what is right, not only before the Lord but also before people. We have also sent with them our brother. We have often tested him in many circumstances and found him to be diligent—and now even more diligent because of his great confidence in you. As for Titus, he is my partner and coworker for you; as for our brothers, they are the messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ. Therefore, show them proof before the churches of your love and of our boasting about you.

For us, the Bible gives clear evidence for association. Here, a representative, chosen and sent by the local church to minster and admonish and encourage other churches associated with one another, albeit, joined together by the cross of Christ and his appointment of the Apostles.

### howbeit these messengers assembled, are not intrusted with any church-power properly so called; or with any jurisdiction over the churches themselves, to exercise any censures either over any churches or persons; or to impose their determination on the churches or officers

>2 Corinthians 1:24 (CSB) I do not mean that we lord it over your faith, but we are workers with you for your joy, because you stand firm in your faith.

>1 John 4:1 (CSB) Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see if they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.

Now here's where it becomes distinctively. This association has no authority over the local church, from whom the representative was chosen and sent out.

We have noticed that the 1689 Confession is the child of the Savoy Declaration and the grandchild of the Westminster Confession of Faith. Many chapters were kept intact with only some minor clarifications added. One of the crucial differences between the 1689 and the Westminster would be this chapter on the church and church polity.

>that many churches holding communion together, do, by their messengers, meet to consider, and give their advice in or about that matter in difference, to be reported to all the churches concerned

This is different than the Presbyterians who do have assemblies, called synods and councils in order to "ministerially, to determine controversies of faith, and cases of conscience; to set down rules and directions for the better ordering of the public worship of God, and government of His church."[^WCF] In other words, their synods and councils do have authority over the local churches--in all matters of church government.

With Baptists, not so much. When we say that the the local church is autonomous, by no means do we insist that every local church is an island on its own. The members of the visible church but joined together under Christ. So, it is wise for local churches to be a part of an association of any sort. Consider.

>Galatians 2:2 (CSB) I went up according to a revelation and presented to them the gospel I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to those recognized as leaders. I wanted to be sure I was not running, and had not been running, in vain.

>Proverbs 3:5–7 (CSB) Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not rely on your own understanding; in all your ways know him, and he will make your paths straight. Don’t be wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD and turn away from evil.

>Proverbs 12:15 (CSB) A fool’s way is right in his own eyes, but whoever listens to counsel is wise.

>Proverbs 13:10 (CSB) Arrogance leads to nothing but strife, but wisdom is gained by those who take advice.

To that end, the autonomy of the local Baptist church only means that those who are only associated with this particular local church can only advise on matters but have no authority. Now, if the church starts acting in contrast to its association, the association should have the authority to remove them from their charter. Think about it, as example, you are a Confession church part of a Reformed Baptists association but then decide to no longer be confessional. You decided to be non-denomination, evangelical church. Which is fine. But then you are no longer associated with that association. The association is distinctively Reformed Baptist. Dropping the confession makes you no longer Reformed Baptist.

Or to use a real life example: Southern Baptist Churches who want to have women as their lead pastors are now in contradiction to their association. So they would be removed.

To the unknowing, this distinctive might seem divisive--as something that keeps us separated from other brothers and sisters. Listen, Rome, Orthodox, and Protestants all are united under the blood of Christ, proclaimed by the historical creeds of the church--Apostles, Nicene, Chalcedonian, and Athanasius. Teach and preach outside of that, you are no longer Christian. But within that, there are distinctions that do bond us closer with other liked minded churches who share the same convictions. Those bonds us together to minister, encourage, share, and advise one another.

I don't have the same convictions concerning preaching, doctrine or church government like Presbyterians, Methodists, Charismatics, or even most Baptists. So let me be in an association with those who do and let me love those other brothers and sisters in Christ because we are forever in Christ.
