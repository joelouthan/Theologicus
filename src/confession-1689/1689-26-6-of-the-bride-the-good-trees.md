## The Text

>Luke 6:43-45 (CSB) “A good tree doesn’t produce bad fruit; on the other hand, a bad tree doesn’t produce good fruit. For each tree is known by its own fruit. Figs aren’t gathered from thornbushes, or grapes picked from a bramble bush. A good person produces good out of the good stored up in his heart. An evil person produces evil out of the evil stored up in his heart, for his mouth speaks from the overflow of the heart.

## The Chapter

**The members of these churches are saints by calling, visibly manifesting and evidencing (in and by their profession and walking) their obedience unto that call of Christ; and do willingly consent to walk together, according to the appointment of Christ; giving up themselves to the Lord, and one to another, by the will of God, in professed subjection to the ordinances of the Gospel.**

## The Confession

### The members of these churches are saints by calling, visibly manifesting and evidencing (in and by their profession and walking) their obedience unto that call of Christ

>Romans 1:7 (CSB) To all who are in Rome, loved by God, called as saints. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

>1 Corinthians 1:2 (CSB) To the church of God at Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called as saints, with all those in every place who call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord—both their Lord and ours.

I write this particular note on the way home from my uncle's funeral. My wife asked me, "Was he a Christian?" I responded, "I can tell you that he was not not a Christian." Today's eulogy spoke about a man who gave generously of his time and money and effort, not only in his local community but in communities worldwide. He was so kind, wise, thoughtful, and gentle to those around him and those to his kids.

Where his heart was at, I could not tell you by his outward actions. All I know he was a good man who did good things for those around him. But from the people who loved and adore (count me among them) he was most certainly not wicked.

I make that point to say--we cannot judge whether or not the Triune God dwells in the heart of man based on morality along. Perhaps someone may not be outwardly evangelical--that is to say they did not speak often or boldly about their Lord God. That is okay. (Trying to make that a thing is not a thing--Evangelicalism.)

But when a man is worthless--a term God uses in his word to describe wicked, deceitful, evil people--we know for a fact that they are a Christian.

I have met many men who can wax eloquently enough to fool outsiders and some believers that they know God and love him. But their actions would boldly and assuredly state that they did not believe God nor did they believe he even existed. For they remained unrepentantly in their folly and wicked ways. When you dare appoach them about their actions, they, much like their orignal father, Adam, are so quick to blame others for the way they are and never taking ownership for themselves. They might apologized but it is a stock response and the heart behind it is always, "I am bored of this--can we just move past this please?".

### and do willingly consent to walk together, according to the appointment of Christ; giving up themselves to the Lord, and one to another, by the will of God, in professed subjection to the ordinances of the Gospel

>Acts 2:41–42 (CSB) So those who accepted his message were baptized, and that day about three thousand people were added to them. They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching, to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to prayer.

>Acts 5:13–14 (CSB) No one else dared to join them, but the people spoke well of them. Believers were added to the Lord in increasing numbers—multitudes of both men and women.

>2 Corinthians 9:13 (CSB) Because of the proof provided by this ministry, they will glorify God for your obedient confession of the gospel of Christ, and for your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone.

As a Reformed Baptist, I count myself as someone who was once an Evangelical but no longer so. I define Evangelical as someone who is bought into Evangelicalism--that is, someone who looks inwardly continuously and constantly to see if they are Christian and they, in turn, put that burden on others and judge them accordingly. As Reformed Baptist, I can no longer abide in that sort of back-breaking ideaology.

But there is one thing I do apprecciate my Evangelical siblings is this one notion of the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and it is this: where people are at now is not where they will end up.

Those who were saved from our sins--we were once dead in our trespasses and sins. Titus 3 rightly called us "once foolish, led astray, enslaved to various passions and pleasures [...] hating ourselves and hating one another." And there are many who first tasted the sweetness of the Holy Spirit many years ago only to stray from God today.

But our God is not only all merciful but all powerful. I speak of these worthless people and that might bring someone you know to mind--someone who fits that description. You might see them in their wickedness and hatred and think, 'Surely, there is no way they would get to God." Based on our flesh, our born state, on our inheritance from Adam, you would be correct--for we are destined to hell to suffer the wrath of Christ for all of eternal.

It is going to take something outside of ourselves--someone who is far more powerful and far more loving--to reach in, change us from the inside out, give us life, and call us "his son."

And this God would have to be not only outside of ourselves in order to change our destiny to hell, but he would have to be outside of our time in order to change our destiny by predestining us to himself before the foundation of the world.

You think there are some are so wicked, they will surely perish. I count myself as one of them as chief of all sinners. And yet, praise be to God that Christ alone came to save sinners.
