## The Chapter

**All persons throughout the world, professing the faith of the gospel, and obedience unto God by Christ according unto it, not destroying their own profession by any errors everting the foundation, or unholiness of conversation, are and may be called visible saints; and of such ought all particular congregations to be constituted.**

## The Confession

### All persons throughout the world, professing the faith of the gospel, and obedience unto God by Christ according unto it, not destroying their own profession by any errors everting the foundation, or unholiness of conversation, are and may be called visible saints

>1 Corinthians 1:2 (CSB) To the church of God at Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called as saints, with all those in every place who call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord—both their Lord and ours.

>Acts 11:26 (CSB) and when he found him he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught large numbers. The disciples were first called Christians at Antioch.

Let me add to that the following verses:

>1 John 2:2 (CSB) He himself is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours, but also for those of the whole world.

And

>1 Timothy 2:5-6 (CSB) For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all, a testimony at the proper time.

In other words:

>John 3:16 (CSB) For God loved the world in this way: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.

We can debate doctrine and theology of non-primary order. Things like evangelism, church government, baptism, and so forth. Those things do not make someone a Christian--just a Christian with certain convictions.

Let me be blunt: being Reformed or Calvinist does not make one closer to God. being in a certain denomination makes you saved or more saved. Being Charismatic does not make one a super Christian. For:

>1 Timothy 2:5-6 (CSB) For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all, a testimony at the proper time.

So to that end, **All persons throughout the world, professing the faith of the gospel** should indeed be in a particular congregation of their choosing.

### and of such ought all particular congregations to be constituted

>Romans 1:7 (CSB) To all who are in Rome, loved by God, called as saints. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

>Ephesians 1:20–22 (CSB) He exercised this power in Christ by raising him from the dead and seating him at his right hand in the heavens—far above every ruler and authority, power and dominion, and every title given, not only in this age but also in the one to come. And he subjected everything under his feet and appointed him as head over everything for the church,

My Evangelistic self dies hard. In other words, I want my particular denomination (Reformed Baptist) to be readily available so that all of my siblings can attend to "kind" of church. But that is what Christ has in store for his siblings. I want my more of churches planted everywhere.

But what makes the invisible church so amazing is that, out of that, the visible church--the denominations and movements that have sprung forth from the Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ--is the most remarkable thing to be hold.

And I know that is not the case for the entire world. And I know that we might not agree on all points. But according to the blessed creeds of the Christian (the following taken from the Nicene Creed):

>I believe in one God,  
>the Father almighty,  
>maker of heaven and earth,  
>of all things visible and invisible.  

... each other us--whether Protestant, Catholic, or Orthodox--are all united and completely unified under the cross of Christ:

>I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ,  
>the Only Begotten Son of God,  
>born of the Father before all ages.  
>God from God, Light from Light,  
>true God from true God,  
>begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father;  
>through him all things were made.

For all of us and our salvation:

>For us men and for our salvation  
>he came down from heaven,  
>and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary,  
>and became man.  

For our sake, Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures:

>For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate,  
>he suffered death and was buried,

And was resurrected on the first Easter Sunday:

>and rose again on the third day  
>in accordance with the Scriptures.  
>He ascended into heaven  
>and is seated at the right hand of the Father.  
>He will come again in glory  
>to judge the living and the dead  
>and his kingdom will have no end.

We are born again by the sheer mercies, grace, and steadfast love of our Father in heaven, through the Christ, by the born again Almighty power of the Holy Spirit:

>I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,  
>who proceeds from the Father and the Son,  
>who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified,  
>who has spoken through the prophets.  

And to that:

>I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church.  
>I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins  
>and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead  
>and the life of the world to come. Amen.
