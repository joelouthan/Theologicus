## The Text

>Romans 1:16–17 (CSB) For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, just as it is written: The righteous will live by faith.

## The Chapter

**Although the gospel be the only outward means of revealing Christ and saving grace, and is, as such, abundantly sufficient thereunto; yet that men who are dead in trespasses may be born again, quickened or regenerated, there is moreover necessary an effectual insuperable work of the Holy Spirit upon the whole soul, for the producing in them a new spiritual life; without which no other means will effect their conversion unto God.**

>Psalm 110:3 (CSB) Your people will volunteer on your day of battle. In holy splendor, from the womb of the dawn, the dew of your youth belongs to you.

>1 Corinthians 2:14 (CSB) But the person without the Spirit does not receive what comes from God’s Spirit, because it is foolishness to him; he is not able to understand it since it is evaluated spiritually.

>Ephesians 1:19–20 (CSB) and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the mighty working of his strength. He exercised this power in Christ by raising him from the dead and seating him at his right hand in the heavens—

### without which no other means will effect their conversion unto God

>John 6:44 (CSB) No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up on the last day.

>2 Corinthians 4:4–6 (CSB) In their case, the god of this age has blinded the minds of the unbelievers to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. For we are not proclaiming ourselves but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’s sake. For God who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of God’s glory in the face of Jesus Christ.

Or to simply put it:

>Acts 4:12 (CSB) There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to people by which we must be saved.”

Take everything you just read and answer the question, "What makes the gospel such good news?"

If salvation was at all dependent on the finite, mortal, sinful, depraved, broken, wicked mankind, then the gospel would not be good news. Thankfully, there is no part of the gospel of Christ Jesus that is dependent upon mankind except for our damnable sins that we were born in and generated with our heart, thoughts, mouth, and hands.

What makes the gospel such good news is that it is Triune God, who alone is good, holy, righteous, merciful, long-suffering, tender, patient, and kind does everything--perfectly, completely, in totality, satisfactory, fully, 100%--to save his people from our sins.

The gospel is the God has done it all. When he comes and he calls, he will beckon you to come and live. You will lay all of your wickedness upon his only begotton Son and in the instantaneous exchange, the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ gives you his righteousness and saves you to himself once and all time.

>Romans 8:30 (CSB) And those he predestined, he also called; and those he called, he also justified; and those he justified, he also glorified.

And some might object: "but I still sin!" My beloved, when you grew up, you didn't immediately become grown. You grew into this age that you are. So too is the growth of God for his people. For:

>Hebrews 6:1–3 (CSB) Therefore, let us leave the elementary teaching about Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, faith in God, teaching about ritual washings, laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. And we will do this if God permits.

>Romans 8:29 (CSB) For those he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, so that he would be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters.

And some might question, "How can I be sure that I am saved?" Has God not been saying this entire time? Do you believe that Christ is the Holy One of God? Do you believe that he died to take away your sins? Did you know that you could not have believe that unless the Triune God dwelled in you?

>2 Corinthians 6:2 (CSB) For he says: At an acceptable time I listened to you, and in the day of salvation I helped you. See, now is the acceptable time; now is the day of salvation!

Now is the acceptable time! Today is the day of salvation! Call upon the name of the Lord and be saved!
