# 19.4 The Command Of The Lord Is Radiant

## The Text

>Psalm 19:8b (CSB) [...] the command of the LORD is radiant, making the eyes light up.

## The Chapter

### To them also he gave sundry judicial laws, which expired together with the state of that people, not obliging any now by virtue of that institution; their general equity only being of moral use.

## The Confession

>1 Corinthians 9:8–10 (CSB) Am I saying this from a human perspective? Doesn’t the law also say the same thing? For it is written in the law of Moses, Do not muzzle an ox while it treads out grain. Is God really concerned about oxen? Isn’t he really saying it for our sake? Yes, this is written for our sake, because he who plows ought to plow in hope, and he who threshes should thresh in hope of sharing the crop.
