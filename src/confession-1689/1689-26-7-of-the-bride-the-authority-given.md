## The Text

>Matthew 28:16-20 (CSB) The eleven disciples traveled to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had directed them. When they saw him, they worshiped, but some doubted. Jesus came near and said to them, “All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe everything I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age."

## The Chapter

**To each of these churches thus gathered, according to his mind declared in his word, he hath given all that power and authority, which is in any way needful for their carrying on that order in worship and discipline, which he hath instituted for them to observe; with commands and rules for the due and right exerting, and executing of that power.**

## The Confession

>Matthew 18:17–18 (CSB) If he doesn’t pay attention to them, tell the church. If he doesn’t pay attention even to the church, let him be like a Gentile and a tax collector to you. Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will have been loosed in heaven.

>1 Corinthians 5:4–5 (CSB) When you are assembled in the name of our Lord Jesus, and I am with you in spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus, hand that one over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.

>1 Corinthians 5:13 (CSB) God judges outsiders. Remove the evil person from among you.

>2 Corinthians 2:6–8 (CSB) This punishment by the majority is sufficient for that person. As a result, you should instead forgive and comfort him. Otherwise, he may be overwhelmed by excessive grief. Therefore I urge you to reaffirm your love to him.

We have many people, since the sins of Adam and Eve, faught with power trying to feebly build their own little kingdoms of sand.

They have no real authority over people--just wolves who have swayed even the elect in order to devour on the little lambs of God.

But the real authority of pastors is not an absolutely authority or self-given authority but only one that is assumed authority given to certain individuals by God by only what is explicitely stated in his Holy Scriptures.

Anything outside of that is extra-biblical or as a common phrase used today, "above our paygrades."

We should not feign expertise when we have none.

In today's context, we have the onset of trauma that has taken a huge toil on the mental health of most people. 

Some pastors foolishly open their mouths and too quickly dismissed the advantage of good, solid therapy especially counsel which is trauma-informed and practiced by a fellow believer.[^1] 

Some pastors grievously which have not been properly trained take upon themselves to help someone who has experienced much trauma and end up doing way more harm than good.

These are two examples of men who are at least foolish and at most, trying to do something way above their paygrade.

A good pastor is one who can see the issues, see the hurt, see the trauma, and see that this person before them will need real help--something that the pastor is not equipped to do so rightfully--and points them in that good direction.

God has granted us this authority and only by what is given through the Scriptures. And remember, according to James 1, there is wisdom by God which he will grant to us if we ask for it.

Be wise and ask for wisdom.

[^1]: Not an absolute impossibity but I would say that the road to recovery is much harder that it has to be if seeking help from someone who does not share your worldiview
