## The Text

>John 10:14-16 (CSB) “I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and my own know me, just as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep. But I have other sheep that are not from this sheep pen; I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. Then there will be one flock, one shepherd.

## The Chapter

**In the execution of this power wherewith he is so intrusted, the Lord Jesus calleth out of the world unto himself, through the ministry of his word, by his Spirit, those that are given unto him by his Father, that they may walk before him in all the ways of obedience, which he prescribeth to them in his word. Those thus called, he commandeth to walk together in particular societies, or churches, for their mutual edification, and the due performance of that public worship, which he requireth of them in the world.**

## The Confession

### In the execution of this power wherewith he is so intrusted, the Lord Jesus calls out of the world unto himself, through the ministry of his word, by his Spirit, those that are given unto him by his Father

>John 10:16 (CSB) But I have other sheep that are not from this sheep pen; I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. Then there will be one flock, one shepherd.

>John 12:32 (CSB) As for me, if I am lifted up from the earth I will draw all people to myself.”

This statement, properly teaches the doctrine behind John 3.

We all know John 3:16--the most beloved verse:

>John 3:16 (CSB) For God loved the world in this way: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.

But we cannot forget the context of John 3:16 in light of John 3.

For the calling out of the world, that is, the effectual, saving calling of his people to himself comes from the grace of the Father by the power of the Holy Spirit:

>John 3:3-6 Jesus replied, “Truly I tell you, unless someone is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.” “How can anyone be born when he is old? ” Nicodemus asked him. “Can he enter his mother’s womb a second time and be born? ” Jesus answered, “Truly I tell you, unless someone is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. Whatever is born of the flesh is flesh, and whatever is born of the Spirit is spirit.

This calling is not a mere reciting of words spoken out of a human but it is the Christ calling out his elect from out of their death in their trespasses and sins into life everlasting.

### that they may walk before him in all the ways of obedience, which he prescribes to them in his word

>Matthew 28:20 (CSB) teaching them to observe everything I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”

To those who are born again--not just doing good things or going to church or donating lots of money--but been given a new heart and his Spirit by the Father and been made alive again can only turn away from themselves, their sins and their hopelessness and have the supernatural power to look upon the risen Son of God--the Worthy Lamb who was slain:

>John 3:14-15 Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.

This turning to the Christ cannot be done if you are dead from the venomous bites of your sin. Never! Dead men cannot turn their heads. Dead men cannot fixed their eyes upon the Christ. Dead men cannot believe and hope in the good news that "Mary has born a son and we call his name Jesus because he has saved his people from their sins!"

Dead or alive: who can look up upon God and live forever?

You must be born again!

### Those thus called, he commands to walk together in particular societies, or churches, for their mutual edification, and the due performance of that public worship, which he requires of them in the world

>Matthew 18:15–20 (CSB) “If your brother sins against you, go tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have won your brother. But if he won’t listen, take one or two others with you, so that by the testimony of two or three witnesses every fact may be established. If he doesn’t pay attention to them, tell the church. If he doesn’t pay attention even to the church, let him be like a Gentile and a tax collector to you. Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will have been loosed in heaven. Again, truly I tell you, if two of you on earth agree about any matter that you pray for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together in my name, I am there among them.”

We have been born again--called from death unto life--to join and be with God forever. But to that, we have been born again--called from death unto life--to join with other believers--the elect who were redeemed from before the foundations of the earth forever and ever.

We live in crazy times. And you think it is because LGBTQ+ is going mainstream or we are pressing into the ways of the world, that is not what I am talking about. Babylon will always be Babylon--I am never shocked by the fact. 

We are lived in desperate, crazy times because we have vast numerous Christians who are called by God unto his only begotten Son and for what? Cease going to church. Never being a part of a local church.

Listen to me: the local church is a commandment of Christ. Every jot and tittle of the New Testament was always written to churches and never to individuals. That individual mindset is because we were born in America with bootstraps and can-do attitudes.

Those words were written with the intention that you were in the local church. I see letters to Epheses and Corinth. I have never read a letter in the Holy Scriptures written to Joseph Louthan, American, born in 1975 in Fort Worth, TX. It ain't in there because it ain't in there.

Lastly, this church idea that so many Christians take as optional? Church is not a manmade institution or human thought but it was the idea of the Lord Jesus Christ:

>Matthew 16:18 And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.

Choose on this day on whom you will serve.
