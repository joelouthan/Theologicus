## The Text

>2 Timothy 3:16–4:5 (CSB) All Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching, for rebuking, for correcting, for training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.  
>
>I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is going to judge the living and the dead, and because of his appearing and his kingdom:  
>
><bgy>Preach the word;</bgy>  
>
>be ready in season and out of season; correct, rebuke, and encourage with great patience and teaching. For the time will come when people will not tolerate sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, will multiply teachers for themselves because they have an itch to hear what they want to hear. They will turn away from hearing the truth and will turn aside to myths. But as for you, exercise self-control in everything, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.

## The Chapter

**Although it be incumbent on the bishops or pastors of the churches, to be instant in preaching the word, by way of office, yet the work of preaching the word is not so peculiarly confined to them but that others also gifted and fitted by the Holy Spirit for it, and approved and called by the church, may and ought to perform it.**

## The Confession

>Acts 11:19–21 (CSB) Now those who had been scattered as a result of the persecution that started because of Stephen made their way as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews. But there were some of them, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who came to Antioch and began speaking to the Greeks also, proclaiming the good news about the Lord Jesus. The Lord’s hand was with them, and a large number who believed turned to the Lord.

>1 Peter 4:10–11 (CSB) Just as each one has received a gift, use it to serve others, as good stewards of the varied grace of God. If anyone speaks, let it be as one who speaks God’s words; if anyone serves, let it be from the strength God provides, so that God may be glorified through Jesus Christ in everything. To him be the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.

There is one primary ministry of the pastors. Not in counseling but of course, it might include that. Caring for the poor and the widow--as God gives grace. Not even in the administration of the church although it is good and right for the longevity and good steward of church.

The one primary ministry of the pastors is to preach the word. It is to boldly proclaim the gospel of God. For:

>Romans 10:14 (CSB) How, then, can they call on him they have not believed in? And how can they believe without hearing about him? And how can they hear without a preacher?

In the myriad of ways that God could have given his imagebearers his redemptive plan, he chose, in his grace, wisdom and good pleasure, from the moment that sin entered into the world, chose to encapsulate that plan into the oratory, spoken, proclaimed, declared, verbal word.

Not songs.

Not skits.

Not programs.

Not churches.

Just the spoken word.

Consider this:

In the first instance, God spoke:

>Genesis 3:14–15 (CSB) So the LORD God said to the serpent: Because you have done this, you are cursed more than any livestock and more than any wild animal. You will move on your belly and eat dust all the days of your life. I will put hostility between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring. He will strike your head, and you will strike his heel.

In the covenants given to men, God spoke:

>Genesis 12:1–3 (CSB) The LORD said to Abram: Go from your land, your relatives, and your father’s house to the land that I will show you. I will make you into a great nation, I will bless you, I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, I will curse anyone who treats you with contempt, and all the peoples on earth will be blessed through you.

In the prophecies, God spoke:

>Ezekiel 36:1 (CSB) “Son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel and say, ‘Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD.

In the call of repentance, God spoke:

>Matthew 4:17 (CSB) From then on Jesus began to preach, “Repent, because the kingdom of heaven has come near.”

In living, God spoke:

>Matthew 4:4 (CSB) He answered, “It is written: Man must not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.”

In calling us from the dead, God spoke:

>John 11:41-43 (CSB) So they removed the stone. Then Jesus raised his eyes and said, “Father, I thank you that you heard me. I know that you always hear me, but because of the crowd standing here I said this, so that they may believe you sent me.” After he said this, he shouted with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out! ”

You can have all the churches, all the programs, the fellowship, the Bible studies, all the music. But when it comes right down to it, you do not have a gathered assembly of saints on the Lord's Day without the preaching the great gospel of God. There is no other way by which we are saved.
