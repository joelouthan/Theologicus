## The Chapter

**Saints by profession are bound to maintain an holy fellowship and communion in the worship of God, and in performing such other spiritual services as tend to their mutual edification; as also in relieving each other in outward things according to their several abilities, and necessities; which communion, according to the rule of the gospel, though especially to be exercised by them, in the relation wherein they stand, whether in families, or churches, yet, as God offereth opportunity, is to be extended to all the household of faith, even all those who in every place call upon the name of the Lord Jesus; nevertheless their communion one with another as saints, doth not take away or infringe the title or propriety which each man hath in his goods and possessions.**

## The Confession

### Saints by profession are bound to maintain a holy fellowship and communion in the worship of God, and in performing such other spiritual services as tend to their mutual edification

>Hebrews 10:24–25 (CSB) And let us consider one another in order to provoke love and good works, not neglecting to gather together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging each other, and all the more as you see the day approaching.

>Hebrews 3:12–13 (CSB) Watch out, brothers and sisters, so that there won’t be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God. But encourage each other daily, while it is still called today, so that none of you is hardened by sin’s deception.

### as also in relieving each other in outward things according to their several abilities, and necessities

>Acts 11:29–30 (CSB) Each of the disciples, according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brothers and sisters who lived in Judea. They did this, sending it to the elders by means of Barnabas and Saul.

### which communion, according to the rule of the gospel, though especially to be exercised by them, in the relation wherein they stand, whether in families

>Ephesians 6:4 (CSB) Fathers, don’t stir up anger in your children, but bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.

### or churches

>1 Corinthians 12:14–27 (CSB) Indeed, the body is not one part but many. If the foot should say, “Because I’m not a hand, I don’t belong to the body,” it is not for that reason any less a part of the body. And if the ear should say, “Because I’m not an eye, I don’t belong to the body,” it is not for that reason any less a part of the body. If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be? But as it is, God has arranged each one of the parts in the body just as he wanted. And if they were all the same part, where would the body be? As it is, there are many parts, but one body. The eye cannot say to the hand, “I don’t need you!” Or again, the head can’t say to the feet, “I don’t need you!” On the contrary, those parts of the body that are weaker are indispensable. And those parts of the body that we consider less honorable, we clothe these with greater honor, and our unrespectable parts are treated with greater respect, which our respectable parts do not need. Instead, God has put the body together, giving greater honor to the less honorable, so that there would be no division in the body, but that the members would have the same concern for each other. So if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it. Now you are the body of Christ, and individual members of it.

### yet, as God offers opportunity, is to be extended to all the household of faith, even all those who in every place call upon the name of the Lord Jesus; nevertheless their communion one with another as saints, does not take away or infringe the title or propriety which each man has in his goods and possessions

>Acts 5:4 (CSB) Wasn’t it yours while you possessed it? And after it was sold, wasn’t it at your disposal? Why is it that you planned this thing in your heart? You have not lied to people but to God.”

>Ephesians 4:28 (CSB) Let the thief no longer steal. Instead, he is to do honest work with his own hands, so that he has something to share with anyone in need.

I don't want to be one of those preachers who love to say, "We live in the times where..." and then I go railing on unbelievers who sin because shocking enough, sinners do sin. However, this message is for the believer:

Go to church.

In my personal life, I know that my parent's generation of Christians do not attend church. That is, I know just as many older (than me) Christians who do not attend the Lord' Day service than those who do. And the numbers are not even close. And I am only counting those I actual know in real life and not randoms off social media.

Why do we go to church? Here are three great reasons.

One, Christ died to unify us to him and build up us--to grow in wisdom and statute:

>Ephesians 4:11-13 (CSB) And he himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, to build up the body of Christ, until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of God’s Son, growing into maturity with a stature measured by Christ’s fullness.

Two, this is not man's idea but the command of Christ:

>Matthew 16:14-20 (CSB) They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others, Elijah; still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”
>
>“But you,” he asked them, “who do you say that I am? ”
>Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.”
>
>Jesus responded, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but my Father in heaven. And I also say to you that you are Peter, and **on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overpower it**. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will have been loosed in heaven.” Then he gave the disciples orders to tell no one that he was the Messiah.

Three, we go to receive the Christ.

We hear the word of God preached. Christ called the Bible "the mouth of God" (Matthew 4:4). And we take the Lord's Supper, the body and blood of Christ, and we receive it because Christ is what we need.

Listen, I am not as evangelical as I once was. Meaning, I am no longer interested in attracting unbelievers to church. I am interested only in feeding his precious lambs (John 21). But likewise, I don't need to emplore you and beg you, the believer who houses the Triune God within your soul, to come to church.

I will trust the Holy Spirit to lead you (Romans 8:5-11) where he wants to go.

But if you do believe in the risen Christ and do not have a legitimate reason not to attend the Lord's Service, stop it. Stop sinning. Repent. Go every Sunday and receive what you really need: the only begotten Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ.

Amen.
