## Prayer

## The Confession

**God, having all life, glory, goodness, blessedness, in and of himself, is alone in and unto himself all-sufficient, not standing in need of any creature which he hath made, nor deriving any glory from them, but only manifesting his own glory in, by, unto, and upon them; he is the alone fountain of all being, of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things, and he hath most sovereign dominion over all creatures, to do by them, for them, or upon them, whatsoever himself pleaseth; in his sight all things are open and manifest, his knowledge is infinite, infallible, and independent upon the creature, so as nothing is to him contingent or uncertain; he is most holy in all his counsels, in all his works, and in all his commands; to him is due from angels and men, whatsoever worship, service, or obedience, as creatures they owe unto the Creator, and whatever he is further pleased to require of them.**

## The Intro

I am not sure if we, Christians, still believe this or not. But for the sake of covering my bases, let me state this.

God does not need anything.

And just so we are clear:

God does not need us.

I could try to paint a picture of a most perfectly content Father and a most perfectly content Son in most perfect harmonious community joined by the Holy Spirit for all of eternity past. And that in of God, they had the most perfect community and the most perfect relationship and were most perfect love. To be honest, it would be a feeble attempt. Because we cannot imagine such a relationship on this side of heaven.

Take for one example: marriage--a common grace of God to all of mankind that is a holy covenant between man and woman in the sight of God that should last forever. Yet, how many of us know someone who has been divorced. The raised hands would be 100%.

This is not so, never be so, and will never be so with the Triune God.

We cannot not imagine unbroken marriage. Sinless relationships. Complete joy-filled unions. We can't truly fathom this because we live ina sin-filled broken world with broken sinners. 

But this content, joy, satisfaction, holiness, love? is all God knew forever. There was no other reality for him.

And why is that. To speak about God is that we cannot simply stop at "he is good" which he is. And he is blessedness or glory or life which he is all these things. But what sets him apart from his creation is that he is the fullness of these things. And if he is truly filled to the max, perfectly with these things, then he does not need anything.

So in our time here today, we are going to explore the external relations of God.

We know God's nature and identity--that was masterfully taught by God. And right after me, Pangborn is going to teach on God's internal relations.

But right now, we know that:

```
I believe in one God,
the Father almighty,
maker of heaven and earth,
of all things visible and invisible.

Nicene Creed
```

Since God is creator, what is he relationship to his creation?

Is he the divine watchmaker that wound up creation like a clock, let us loose, and departed forever. Some feel like that way but we know he is not because the Bible says otherwise.

Is he some powerful deity that is battles his arch nemesis--namely Satan--where God barely squeaks by with a victory. That is Duelism and that type of thinking is reserved for comic books and not from the Bible.

What is God's relationship to his creation? What is God's relation to us--mankind, human, the so-called image bearers of God?

We will explore and answer the following questions:

- How God is not like us
- How God is towards us and for us
- What should we be towards him

We will attempt to answer these questions by breaking up this part of the confession and explaining with Scripture.

### How God is not like us?

#### The All in all

**God, having all life, glory, goodness, blessedness, in and of himself**

>“God is alone in and unto himself all-sufficient. God is all-sufficient not only in Himself, but also for Himself, in the absolute sense, needing nothing from any creature. Christians often use expressions that are well meaning but that, if analyzed carefully, approach blasphemy. For example, “I’m so glad that so-and-so allowed God to work through him,” or “Thank you for letting God work through you.” Does this mean that God cannot work through me unless I allow Him? God does not need our permission to do anything, any more than He needed Paul’s permission to appear to him on the Damascus road, or Judas’ to use him for His greater glory, or that of Balaam’s ass to speak prophetically. God is self-sufficient, both in Himself and for Himself.”

>R. C. Sproul. Truths We Confess. 55-57.

#### The Aseity of God

**is alone in and unto himself all-sufficient, not standing in need of any creature which he hath made, nor deriving any glory from them, but only manifesting his own glory in, by, unto, and upon them**

>Acts 17:23–28 (CSB)  
><sup>24</sup> <bgy>The God who made the world and everything in it—he is Lord of heaven and earth—does not live in shrines made by hands.</bgy>
>
><sup>25</sup> <bgy>Neither is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives everyone life and breath and all things.</bgy>

#### The Source of Everything

**he is the alone fountain of all being, of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things**

>Romans 11:33–36 (CSB)  
><sup>33</sup> Oh, the depth of the riches and the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments and untraceable his ways!
>
><sup>34</sup> For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?
>
><sup>35</sup> And who has ever given to God, that he should be repaid?
>
><sup>36</sup> For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the glory forever. Amen.

#### Sees and Knows Everything

**in his sight all things are open and manifest, his knowledge is infinite, infallible, and independent upon the creature, so as nothing is to him contingent or uncertain**

#### Perfection in who is his. what he thinks and what he does

**he is most holy in all his counsels, in all his works, and in all his commands**

- How God is not like us
  - Needs nothing from us
  - He is holy - he would not do as we do
  - He is wise - he would not think as we think
  - He is immutable - he is without passions--we are full of passions
    - Lord of the Rings quote here
  - He is Triune
    - Augustine - Three persons, three wills, three minds, three hearts. Triune God--three persons, one will, one mind, one heart.
  - Who God is to us
  - What God has said to us?
  - What God has given to us?
  - How are we like God -or- how are we made in the image of God?

## So what?

### How God is toward us and for us

#### He is our All in all

>1 Corinthians 15:28 (CSB) When everything is subject to Christ, then the Son himself will also be subject to the one who subjected everything to him, so that God may be all in all.

#### He is our Source of Everything

>Colossians 1:15–20 (CSB)  
><sup>15</sup> He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. 
>
><sup>16</sup> For everything was created by him, in heaven and on earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities— all things have been created through him and for him. 
>
><sup>17</sup> He is before all things, and by him all things hold together. 
>
><sup>18</sup> He is also the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in everything. 
>
><sup>19</sup> For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, 
>
><sup>20</sup> and through him to reconcile everything to himself, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.

#### He is most Sovereign

### What are we towards him?

#### We are to worship, serve, and obey him

**he hath most sovereign dominion over all creatures, to do by them, for them, or upon them, whatsoever himself pleaseth**

We were made to worship. Yet, the sins of Adam and Eve were not simply they broke a commandment of God. But they have exchanged their right worship of God to worshiping not-God.

This is the damned exchange in Romans 1:

>Romans 1:21-23 (CSB) For though they knew God, they did not glorify him as God or show gratitude. Instead, their thinking became worthless, and their senseless hearts were darkened. Claiming to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man, birds, four-footed animals, and reptiles.

#### We are to be perfect

**whatever he is further pleased to require of them**

Not just "in order to be with God, you must be perfect". No, because we are his creation and he is a perfect Creator, he demands perfection from his creation image bearers. Creation already obeys him. He is the their Creator Lord. They cannot help but to obey him. Angels obey him. To those angels who do not obey him, they are instantly ejected. (There is no epic fight. Christ said, "fell like lightning")

#### Yet we have completely, totally, immensely, failed him in everything we have done

>Romans 3:10-12

>Romans 3:23

>Titus 3:3

>Ephesians 2:1

#### We need him

He does not need us but he wants us and loves us. We need him and that is why he sent his only begotten Son

>John 3:16

>Romans 3:21-26

>Titus 3:3-7

>Ephesians 2:1-10

>John 1:16-18 (CSB) Indeed, we have all received grace upon grace from his fullness, for the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God. The one and only Son, who is himself God and is at the Father’s side —he has revealed him

### Closing

>Colossians 1:9-14 (CSB) For this reason also, since the day we heard this, we haven’t stopped praying for you. We are asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding, so that you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him: bearing fruit in every good work and growing in the knowledge of God, being strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might, so that you may have great endurance and patience, joyfully giving thanks to the Father, who has enabled you to share in the saints’ inheritance in the light. He has rescued us from the domain of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son he loves. In him we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
