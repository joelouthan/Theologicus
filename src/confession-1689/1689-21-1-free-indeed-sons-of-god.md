## The Text

>Romans 8:18–21 (CSB) For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is going to be revealed to us. For the creation eagerly waits with anticipation for God’s sons to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to futility—not willingly, but because of him who subjected it—in the hope that the creation itself will also be set free from the bondage to decay into the glorious freedom of God’s children.

## The Chapter

**The liberty which Christ hath purchased for believers under the gospel, consists in their freedom from the guilt of sin, the condemning wrath of God, the rigour and curse of the law, and in their being delivered from this present evil world, bondage to Satan, and dominion of sin, from the evil of afflictions, the fear and sting of death, the victory of the grave, and ever- lasting damnation: as also in their free access to God, and their yielding obedience unto Him, not out of slavish fear, but a child-like love and willing mind.**

**All which were common also to believers under the law for the substance of them; but under the New Testament the liberty of Christians is further enlarged, in their freedom from the yoke of a ceremonial law, to which the Jewish church was subjected, and in greater boldness of access to the throne of grace, and in fuller communications of the free Spirit of God, than believers under the law did ordinarily partake of.**

## The Confession

### The liberty which Christ has purchased for believers under the gospel, consists in their freedom from the guilt of sin, the condemning wrath of God, the severity and curse of the law

>Galatians 3:13 (CSB) Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, because it is written, Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.

To loudly echo the words of Paul, "What shall we say to these things? If God is for us who can be against us?" Those of the people of God are perfectly, in totality completely all the way saved to God forever and ever.

Are you in guilt from sin? Absolutely not. This is the blessed holy one only begotten Son of God fully God who does everything perfectly even unto his death and beyond death. He condescended to us so that he could save us. And we, as the children of God, first born into sin, can't help to think that God might have missed something because no one can be that good and that perfect. Surely, not all of our sin is not washed away because of what Christ has done and we have done nothing but brought our wretched filth to him for him to die for us?

And since our broken mind and hearts think that God is not completely good and perfect, in that he must have missed some sin because we still struggle mightily with sin, that God still has some wrath left over for us? Now make no mistake: God does discipline us. Why? Because we are his children and he loves us and he is bringing us all the way home. (Hebrews 12:6; Romans 8:29) But God our Father is not the evil, gruesome abusive dad that we might have experienced for some of us with traumatic childhoods--like myself.

Think about this way. Those of us with abusive parents and for a moment, if you ever confuse your abusive parent for the Almighty God of the Universe, then take a moment, sit down and open your Bible. Start with page 1.

Read Genesis. Did your abusive parent create the heavens and earth?

Read Exodus. Did your drunk dad rescue the people of God from tyranny and slavery?

Read Leviticus. Is your evil parent even close to being perfect?

Go on. Compare the Loveliness of God with your parents. They fall short. We have all fallen short.

So God the Father sent his only begotten Son to rescue you and me from our depravity and sin. Christ exchanged his righteousness to us for our sins upon him and then right wrath of God fell on Christ for our sin.

Why would Christ mess up in that? Remember, he is fully God. He didn't mess up in that. Therefore, God has no more wrath for you. When you and I sin, there are consequences for our sin--that is the brokenness of sin. But God's response is only grace upon blessed grace and tenderest mercies every single morning.

### and in their being delivered from this present evil world

>Galatians 1:4 (CSB) who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father.

>John 17:14-16 (CSB) I have given them your word. The world hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. I am not praying that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one. They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.

We are citizens of two different worlds--two different kingdoms. The moment we were born again, we could not only see the kingdom of God but we are now part of the kingdom of God (John 3:3-5) Unless we are foolish and completely naive, we feel that strain and tension between this world and the world to come. Some days, it feels like we are being torn into two between these words. We still sin. We still feel its effects even when we don't sin. We grieve. We are saddened. We remorse. We are devastated.

>Romans 5:3-5 (CSB) And not only that, but we also boast in our afflictions, because we know that affliction produces endurance, endurance produces proven character, and proven character produces hope. This hope will not disappoint us, because God’s love has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.

But God will not let us descend into hell and he will not let us see decay. We have his Son--we have the Christ! Who alone is the way, the truth, and the life. And in his presence alone is the fullness of joy and at his right hand are pleasures forevermore. (Psalm 16:10-11; John 14:6)

### bondage to Satan

>Acts 26:18 (CSB) to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a share among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’

Yes, at once time Satan was the prince of the air and this was his kingdom to rule and reign as he will. That is true. But blessed saint, remember the perfections of the Christ. Christ is so perfect and good and holy, that when he died, that is when accomplished his greatest feats!

>John 16:8-11 (CSB) When he comes, he will convict the world about sin, righteousness, and judgment: About sin, because they do not believe in me; about righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you will no longer see me; and about judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.

>John 12:31-33 (CSB) Now is the judgment of this world. Now the ruler of this world will be cast out. As for me, if I am lifted up from the earth I will draw all people to myself.” He said this to indicate what kind of death he was about to die.

And

>Colossians 2:15 (ESV) He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him.

Christ, in his sin-destroying death, put Satan, demons, hell, and death to open shame! The powers of darkness are constantly publicly humiliated and there is no relief from this scorn. They have been soundly defeated and they carry the shame of their lack of power to usurp the Alpha and Omega all the way to the eternal lake of fire!

### and dominion of sin

>Romans 8:3 (CSB) For what the law could not do since it was weakened by the flesh, God did. He condemned sin in the flesh by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh as a sin offering,

Sin as we might. Fallen as we were. Mistakes we will make. We are not captured to sin. Not any longer. We have the Christ! The Father and the Son have their eternal almight grip upon our souls. We are no longer infected. We are no longer prisoners but set free!

### from the evil of afflictions

>Romans 8:28 (CSB) We know that all things work together for the good of those who love God, who are called according to his purpose.

Circumstances, sin of this world, sin of others will still come for us. The defeated armies of Satan still lob their fiery arrows of despair right at our hearts. 

### the fear and sting of death, the victory of the grave

>1 Corinthians 15:54–57 (CSB) When this corruptible body is clothed with incorruptibility, and this mortal body is clothed with immortality, then the saying that is written will take place: Death has been swallowed up in victory. Where, death, is your victory? Where, death, is your sting? The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!

>Romans 8:31-37 (CSB) What, then, are we to say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us? He did not even spare his own Son but gave him up for us all. How will he not also with him grant us everything? Who can bring an accusation against God’s elect? God is the one who justifies. Who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is the one who died, but even more, has been raised; he also is at the right hand of God and intercedes for us. Who can separate us from the love of Christ? Can affliction or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? As it is written:  
>Because of you  
>we are being put to death all day long;  
>we are counted as sheep to be slaughtered.  
>No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.

Let me let Octavius Winslow expound on this blessed truth:

>"Through him that loved us." Here is the great secret of our victory, the source of our triumph. Behold the mystery explained, how a weak, timid believer, often running from his own shadow, is yet “more than a conqueror” over his many and mighty foes.
>
>To Christ who loved him, who gave himself for him, who died in his stead, and lives to intercede on his behalf, the glory of the triumph is ascribed. And this is the song he chants, “Thanks be to God which gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.”
>
>Through the conquest which he himself obtained, through the grace which he imparts, through the strength which he inspires, through the intercession which he presents, in all our “tribulation, and distress, and persecution, and famine, and nakedness, and peril, and sword” we are “more than conquerors.” Accounted though we are as “sheep for the slaughter,” yet our Great Shepherd, Himself slain for the sheep, guides his flock, and has declared that no one shall pluck them out of his hand.

### and everlasting damnation

>2 Thessalonians 1:10 (CSB) on that day when he comes to be glorified by his saints and to be marveled at by all those who have believed, because our testimony among you was believed.

Winslow continues:

>We are more than conquerors through his grace who loved us in the very circumstances that threaten to overwhelm. Fear not, then, the darkest cloud, nor the proudest waves, nor the deepest needs- in these very things you shall, through Christ, prove triumphant. Nor shrink from the battle with the “last enemy.” Death received a death-wound when Christ died. You face a conquered foe. He stands at your side a crownless king, and waving a broken scepter. Your death shall be another victory over the believer’s last foe. Planting your foot of faith upon his prostrate neck, you shall spring into glory, more than a conqueror, through him that loved you. Thus passing to glory in triumph, you shall go to swell the ranks of the “noble army of martyrs”- those Christian heroes of whom it is recorded, “THEY OVERCAME HIM BY THE BLOOD Of THE LAMB.”
>
>Octavius Winslow. No Condemnation in Christ Jesus. 229.

### as also in their free access to God, and their yielding obedience unto Him, not out of slavish fear

>Romans 8:15 (CSB) For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear. Instead, you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father!”

TODO:

### but a child-like love and willing mind

>Luke 1:73–75 (CSB) the oath that he swore to our father Abraham. He has given us the privilege, since we have been rescued from the hand of our enemies, to serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness in his presence all our days.

>1 John 4:18 (CSB) There is no fear in love; instead, perfect love drives out fear, because fear involves punishment. So the one who fears is not complete in love.

### All which were common also to believers under the law for the substance of them

>Galatians 3:9–14 (CSB) Consequently, those who have faith are blessed with Abraham, who had faith. For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, because it is written, Everyone who does not do everything written in the book of the law is cursed. Now it is clear that no one is justified before God by the law, because the righteous will live by faith. But the law is not based on faith; instead, the one who does these things will live by them. Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, because it is written, Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree. The purpose was that the blessing of Abraham would come to the Gentiles by Christ Jesus, so that we could receive the promised Spirit through faith.

### but under the New Testament the liberty of Christians is further enlarged, in their freedom from the yoke of a ceremonial law, to which the Jewish church was subjected, and in greater boldness of access to the throne of grace, and in fuller communications of the free Spirit of God, than believers under the law did ordinarily partake of

>John 7:38–39 (CSB) The one who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, will have streams of living water flow from deep within him.” He said this about the Spirit. Those who believed in Jesus were going to receive the Spirit, for the Spirit had not yet been given because Jesus had not yet been glorified.

>Hebrews 10:19–21 (CSB) Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have boldness to enter the sanctuary through the blood of Jesus—he has inaugurated for us a new and living way through the curtain (that is, through his flesh)—and since we have a great high priest over the house of God,

>John 8:35-36 (CSB) A slave does not remain in the household forever, but a son does remain forever. So if the Son sets you free, you really will be free.

Beloved, you are completely free. No matter what is going on in your life, you belong to the Almighty God. If you belong to him, you are free indeed. Forever and ever.
