>Matthew 4:4 (CSB) He answered, “It is written: Man must not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.”

## The Intro

Today, we are going to answer some basic questions about the Bible:

- What is the Bible?
- What does the Bible contain?
- How did we get the Bible?
- Last and certainly not least, so what?

"So what?" I could stand here and give you a bunch of trivia facts about the Bible. What I want for you and me to come away from today's conference is to answer the question, "So what? What does the Bible mean for me as a child of God?"

TODO: teaching in reserve 1) comes from the Spirit 2) get the 66 books 3) this is what it is for

## What is the Bible?

### 1689.1.1 On the Holy Scriptures

**The Holy Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible rule of all saving knowledge, faith, and obedience, although the light of nature, and the works of creation and providence do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as to leave men inexcusable; yet are they not sufficient to give that knowledge of God and his will which is necessary unto salvation. Therefore it pleased the Lord at sundry times and in divers manners to reveal himself, and to declare that his will unto his church; and afterward for the better preserving and propagating of the truth, and for the more sure establishment and comfort of the church against the corruption of the flesh, and the malice of Satan, and of the world, to commit the same wholly unto writing; which maketh the Holy Scriptures to be most necessary, those former ways of God's revealing his will unto his people being now ceased.**

- only source of how are are saved by God
  - No other place
  - outside the Bible? you are not going to have saving knowledge
- Modern: the reduction of the Bible as yet-another-piece-of-literature
- yet, it please the Lord at various times to reveal himself in his word through 40 plus authors that making up the 66 books of the Bible.

## What is in the Bible?

### 1689.1.2 The Old & New Testament of the Holy Scriptures

**All of which are given by the inspiration of God, to be the rule of faith and life.**

### 1689.1.3 On The Apocrypha of the Holy Scriptures

**The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration, are no part of the canon or rule of the Scripture, and, therefore, are of no authority to the church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved or made use of than other human writings.**


## How did we receive this Bible?

### 1689.1.8 On the Inspiration of the Holy Scriptures

**The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of the people of God of old), and the New Testament in Greek (which at the time of the writing of it was most generally known to the nations), being immediately inspired by God, and by his singular care and providence kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentic; so as in all controversies of religion, the church is finally to appeal to them. But because these original tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have a right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded in the fear of God to read and search them, therefore they are to be translated into the vulgar language of every nation unto which they come, that the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship him in an acceptable manner, and through patience and comfort of the Scriptures may have hope.**

## So what?

1\. **Confidence despite the urge to downgrade or eliminate laws** -- we are at a place in time where the world and even some Christians are so desperate to get the law of God to make it mean what he so plainly says. You have heard, "Jesus never talked about marriage.

>Matthew 19:4-6 (CSB) “Haven’t you read,” he replied, “that he who created them in the beginning made them male and female, and he also said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh’? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one separate.”

It's right there. Clear as a bell. Here's the worldly response: "Well, Jesus didn't say it is *not* not between man and man or woman and woman.

The same infallible, same perfect Scriptures that Christ himself equates as "the mouth of God" (Matthew 4:4) contains the same laws of God that demands our perfection in order for us to be God. But why would you want to change any of the Scriptures? You and I and the world changing one dot one tittle of the law will not save us. We need to fulfill the law. And James said, "Break one law and we break them all." Who is going to save us?

It is the same infallible, same perfect Scriptures that contain the law of God that also gives us a plan of salvation. Trust in the Law Fulfiller--that is, Jesus Christ--call upon his name and you will be saved.

Same Bible. Tells us how infinitely far we are in our depravity and what the Almighty Christ did to save his people from our sins.

2\. **Confidence despite apparent contradictions** - Despite written with the minds and hands of human authors, their inspiration did not come from within their IQ, schooling, EQ, creative talents or even their command of their written language--although, all of that is factored into the word we have today. No, all Scripture is inspired and breathed out by the Holy Spirit:

>2 Timothy 3:16–17 (CSB) All Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching, for rebuking, for correcting, for training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.

This word--these Scriptures are outside of our world. They are completely and wholly supernatural. Go to all the Christian schools. Study away your life. Search the Scriptures and without the Holy Spirit opening up our minds and our hearts, we will search these Scriptures in vain. 

Even when you see contradictions... take Romans 4 and James 2. You know where I am going with this. Paul quotes Genesis 15.

>Romans 4:3 (CSB) For what does the Scripture say? Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness.

What does James say? On the surface, it seems he is countering what Paul is saying:

>James 2:22-24 (CSB) You see that faith was active together with his works, and by works, faith was made complete, and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness, and he was called God’s friend. You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.

Paul would not have been offended but he would have agreed. "Yes, James..."

>Ephesians 2:10 (CSB) For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared ahead of time for us to do.

Luke chimes in:

>Acts 17:25 (CSB) Neither is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives everyone life and breath and all things.

We are not saved by doing good works. But when we are saved, we do good works for our neighbor. Remember the words of Christ:

>Matthew 22:37-39 (CSB) He said to him, “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the greatest and most important command. The second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself.

The second is like it. You love God? Love your neighbor. John agrees:

>1 John 4:20-21 (CSB) If anyone says, “I love God,” and yet hates his brother or sister, he is a liar. For the person who does not love his brother or sister whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen. And we have this command from him: The one who loves God must also love his brother and sister.

When it seems we have stumbled upon an apparent contradiction, be humble. You and I ain't the first. Don't you think when TODO: the council canonized the 66 books, that they didn't already think of that? It is the hubris of the modern person to think that we caught something that the early church totally whiffed on.

Is it that they completely missed it or is it the possibility that we have over 2,000 years of Christ building his church to which the gates of hell will not withstand? And that generation after generation stood fast die even to the point of torture and death for this truth--this knowledge of salvation, faith, and obedience.

We don't have to change one word or idea. When we come upon something that is out of sorts, we must remember we are not the first and we must remember the entire character of God Almighty.

3\. Try to remove the Bible, the Bible lives forever

>Isaiah 55:10 (CSB) For just as rain and snow fall from heaven and do not return there without saturating the earth and making it germinate and sprout, and providing seed to sow and food to eat,

>Matthew 4:4 (CSB) He answered, “It is written: Man must not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.”

Burn all Bibles and delete the entire Bible from the internet. Guess what? You can't eradicate it. The Bible does not come from man but from God. 

>Romans 10:17 (CSB) So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the message about Christ.

We will still be saved by the message about Christ. The Bible will never die because God is the God of the everlasting.

Here's the first point and the last point:

4\. **All saving knowledge comes from the scriptures alone** - what's does the scriptures say? there is no other name by which we are saved; here is the gospel:

For here is love:

>Genesis 3:15  
>I will put enmity between you and the woman,  
>and between your offspring and her offspring;  
>he shall bruise your head,  
>and you shall bruise his heel.

And here is love:

>Deuteronomy 7:6-8 “For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth. It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the LORD set his love on you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples, but it is because the LORD loves you and is keeping the oath that he swore to your fathers, that the LORD has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.

And here is love:

>Psalm 103:15-18 As for man, his days are like grass; he flourishes like a flower of the field; for the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and its place knows it no more. But the steadfast love of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him, and his righteousness to children’s children, to those who keep his covenant and remember to do his commandments.

And here is love:

>Ezekiel 36:22-28 And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, that they may walk in my statutes and keep my rules and obey them. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.

And here is love:

>Matthew 1:21 She shall bare a son and you shall call his name Jesus for He will save His people from their sins

And here is love:

>John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.

And here is love:

>Romans 5:8 but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

And here is love:

>2 Corinthians 5:21 For our sake, He made Him to be sin who knew no sin so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.

And here is love:

>Romans 9:25-26  
>… Those who were not my people I will call ‘my people,’  
>and her who was not beloved I will call ‘beloved.’  
>And in the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’  
>there they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’

And here is love:

>Galatians 2:20 I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.

And here is love:

>Romans 8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.

And here is love:

>Romans 8:38-39 For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

And... 

>1 John 4:10 In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.**

Don't you know that the tax collector, who heard the ordinary preaching of the gospel, he was cut to the heart! He stood off and away from the gathered church, would not dare raise his eyes to the Triune but he beat his chest and cried out, "**GOD HAVE MERCY ON ME, A SINNER!** (Luke 18:13)

Not for a moment did the tax collector try to change the words of God. He heard the law and he was found wanting. He truly saw himself for the first time because God opened his eyes for the first time.

He called upon the God who just in wrath--but the only God poured out his saving mercies every day--never ceasing:

>Lamentations 3:22-24 (CSB)  
>Because of the LORD’s faithful love  
>we do not perish,  
>for his mercies never end.  
>They are new every morning;  
>great is your faithfulness!  
>I say, “The LORD is my portion,  
>therefore I will put my hope in him.”

The tax collector knew this. You know this. And I know this.

These things were written, in this Bible, all 66 books, containing saving knowledge of God, so that you and my joy may be complete. (1 John 1:4)
