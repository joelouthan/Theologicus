## The Text

>Matthew 4:4 (CSB) He answered, “It is written: Man must not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.”

## The Intro

In an CNN Red Chair Interview, Richard Dawkins was asked what would he say if he met God after his death:

>What's going to happen when I die, if I met god in the unlikely event after I died, I think the first thing I would say is well, which one are you? Are you Zeus? Are you Thor? Are you Baal? Are you Mithras? Are you Yahweh? Which god are you?

Which is a bit peculiar, to say the least. But that bit of end-of-ones-life banter with the Holy Almighty God is leading up to what Dawkins really wants to ask and I quote:

>And why did you take such great pains to conceal yourself and to hide away from us? 
>
> Richard Dawkins. CNN Red Chair Interview. September 5, 2012. [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/videos/living/2012/09/05/orig-red-chair-richard-dawkins.cnn)

But God did not hide himself. Not even close. I would even give Mr. Dawkins a fair shake if Christ came in as a nobody and left as a nobody and then all of sudden myth after myths started coming up about some son of a carpenter in the Palestinian Middle East some 2000 years ago.

Christ came in as a nobody, this is true. Yet, it pleased the Father by the power of the Spirit to reveal God in the flesh--his only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, Son of God who is God:

>John 1:14–18 (CSB) The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. We observed his glory, the glory as the one and only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. (John testified concerning him and exclaimed, “This was the one of whom I said, ‘The one coming after me ranks ahead of me, because he existed before me.’ ”)

Yet, the entire basis of the Jewish faith prophesied that this was to be start. Starting with Genesis and ending with Malachi. Over 200 prophecies about the upcoming Messiah:

>Indeed, we have all received grace upon grace from his fullness, for the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.

Christ, born of a virgin, into a know-nothing family, in a know-nothing back-country town of Bethlehem.

>Isaiah 53:1-2 (CSB) Who has believed what we have heard?  
>And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?  
>He grew up before him like a young plant  
>and like a root out of dry ground.  
>He didn’t have an impressive form  
>or majesty that we should look at him,  
>no appearance that we should desire him.

All of humankind, you, me, and Mr. Dawkins, included are without excuse. From Adam onwards, God has written his moral law upon our hearts. Despite our born sin nature and our own sin, we try to suppress that God exist or God is not who he says he is why? So that we can do sin more--so that we can do what is right in our own eyes. That is our natural born state.

But God, fully perfect, fully good, fully holy, and fully merciful and love, did what for the world? Sent his only begotten Son.

And for all the atheism and agnosticism and suppression of the truth that the sons of Adam try to come up with, there is no one in their right mind can deny the historical Jesus of Nazareth. You wouldn't just be denying the Bible (that is easy enough) but you would be denying the historical records of the greatest empire of all time: the Greco-Roman Empire. Deny that Jesus ever existed and you would look like a fool.

>John 1:18 (CSB) No one has ever seen God. The one and only Son, who is himself God and is at the Father’s side—he has revealed him.

God did reveal himself. He sent his precious Son to live and die and save his people from their sins. (Matthew 1:21)

Today, we are going to answer some basic questions about the Bible:

- Where does the Bible come from? What is the source?
- What does the Bible contain?
- What is the Bible about and what is it for? What is the purpose of the Bible?
- Last and certainly not least, so what?

"So what?" I could stand here and give you a bunch of trivia facts about the Bible. What I want for you and me to come away from today's conference is to answer the question, "So what? What does the Bible mean for me as an adopted child of God?"

## Where does the Bible come from? What is the source?

### 1689.1.8 On the Inspiration of the Holy Scriptures

**The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of the people of God of old), and the New Testament in Greek (which at the time of the writing of it was most generally known to the nations), being immediately inspired by God, and by His singular care and providence kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentic; so as in all controversies of religion, the church is finally to appeal to them. But because these original tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have a right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded in the fear of God to read, and search them, therefore they are to be translated into the vulgar language of every nation unto which they come, that the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship Him in an acceptable manner, and through patience and comfort of the Scriptures may have hope.**

- only the original manuscripts that were inspired by the Spirit through the mind and heart and soul and hand of the author unto the papyrus and parchment.
- will have slight differences but none of them disagree with each other when it comes to doctrine, theology, law and the gospel.
- in other words, there isn't a copy of the word ever in existence that allows a sin that we have mistranslated or something that gets the gospel wrong. Neither, "Oopsies, homosexuality is permissable by the Holy God" nor "Oh, I am sorry--we have to break our backs to earn the love and grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. Silly me."

## What is the Bible?

*What does the Bible contain?*

### 1689.1.2 The Old & New Testament of the Holy Scriptures

**Under the name of Holy Scripture, or the Word of God written, are now contained all the books of the Old and New Testaments, which are these:**

**OF THE OLD TESTAMENT: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, I Samuel, II Samuel, I Kings, II Kings, I Chronicles, II Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, The Song of Solomen, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations,Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi**

**OF THE NEW TESTAMENT: Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, The Acts of the Apostles, Paul's Epistle to the Romans, I Corinthians, II Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, I Thessalonians, II Thessalonians, I Timothy, II Timothy, To Titus, To Philemon, The Epistle to the Hebrews, Epistle of James, The first and second Epistles of Peter, The first, second, and third Epistles of John, The Epistle of Jude, The Revelation**

**All of which are given by the inspiration of God, to be the rule of faith and life.**

- never forget, all of the Scriptures are about the Lord Jesus Christ. For it is Christ, the Son of God who is God said:

>John 5:39 (CSB) You pore over the Scriptures because you think you have eternal life in them, and yet they testify about me.

If you are digging in the Bible hoping for eternal life, then pay attention to what the Bible is saying outloud and clearly:

>John 3:14–15 (CSB) “Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.

### 1689.1.3 On The Apocrypha of the Holy Scriptures

**The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration, are no part of the canon or rule of the Scripture, and, therefore, are of no authority to the church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved or made use of than other human writings.**

- Quote from Sproul's "Truths We Confess" - "It's worth the read like any good piece of literature. But divinely inspired, it is not."

William Perkins in his wonderful book, "The Art of Prophesying and the Calling of the Ministry," (while not explicitly linked to the Confession, it is a great little read that pairs well in teaching parts of the Confession) puts it succinctly on the Apocrypha:

- They were not written by the prophets
- They were not written in Hebrew
- In the New Testament, neither Christ nor the apostles appeal to the testimony of those books
- They include false teaching which is contrary to the Scriptures[^perkins-apocrypha]

## What is in the Bible?

*What is the Bible about?*

### 1689.1.1 On the Holy Scriptures

**The Holy Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible rule of all saving knowledge, faith, and obedience, although the light of nature, and the works of creation and providence do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as to leave men inexcusable; yet they are not sufficient to give that knowledge of God and His will which is necessary unto salvation. Therefore it pleased the Lord at sundry times and in diversified manners to reveal Himself, and to declare (that) His will unto His church; and afterward for the better preserving and propagating of the truth, and for the more sure establishment and comfort of the church against the corruption of the flesh, and the malice of Satan, and of the world, to commit the same wholly unto writing; which makes the Holy Scriptures to be most necessary, those former ways of God's revealing His will unto His people being now completed.**

- Gary Thomas. Sacred Pathways. Made notice of the personality types of the worshippers of God. Some in music. Some in art. Some in nature. Some in the study.

>1 Corinthians 10:31 (CSB) So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything for the glory of God.

- there are so many things given to all of mankind by the hand of God that certain reveals that there is a creator and he is sovereign over all of his creation
- but no matter how many sunsets, trees, rivers, or Grand Canyons; infinite data and books; endless music and creation of art--will NEVER save not one son of Adam to God
- how are we are saved by God--that is saving knowledge, faith, and obedience--can only be found in the Scriptures. No exception.
- Modern mindset
  - the reduction of the Bible as yet-another-piece-of-literature akin to The Lord of the Rings, Autobiography of Malcolm X or even the Quran
  - "How can you be so sure? What if a person cannot read?" You mean like 99% of the people mentioned in the pages of the Bible? Ordinary means of grace--the preaching of the word of God--is not an new thing. It is an ancient thing going all the way back to God preaching the law in Genesis 2 and proclaiming the gospel in Genesis 3
- yet, it please the Lord at various times to reveal himself in his word through 40 plus authors that making up the 66 books of the Bible.

## So what?

1\. **Confidence despite the urge to downgrade or eliminate laws** -- we are at a place in time where the world and even some Christians are so desperate to get the law of God to make it mean what he so plainly says. You have heard, "Jesus never talked about marriage.

>Matthew 19:4-6 (CSB) “Haven’t you read,” he replied, “that he who created them in the beginning made them male and female, and he also said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh’? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one separate.”

It's right there. Clear as a bell. Here's the worldly response: "Well, Jesus didn't say it is *not* not between man and man or woman and woman.

The same infallible, same perfect Scriptures that Christ himself equates as "the mouth of God" (Matthew 4:4) contains the same laws of God that demands our perfection in order for us to be God. But why would you want to change any of the Scriptures? You and I and the world changing one dot one tittle of the law will not save us. We need to fulfill the law. And James said, "Break one law and we break them all." Who is going to save us?

It is the same infallible, same perfect Scriptures that contain the law of God that also gives us a plan of salvation. Trust in the Law Fulfiller--that is, Jesus Christ--call upon his name and you will be saved.

Same Bible. Tells us how infinitely far we are in our depravity and what the Almighty Christ did to save his people from our sins.

2\. **Confidence despite apparent contradictions** - Despite written with the minds and hands of human authors, their inspiration did not come from within their IQ, schooling, EQ, creative talents or even their command of their written language--although, all of that is factored into the word we have today. No, all Scripture is inspired and breathed out by the Holy Spirit:

>2 Timothy 3:16–17 (CSB) All Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching, for rebuking, for correcting, for training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.

This word--these Scriptures are outside of our world. They are completely and wholly supernatural. Go to all the Christian schools. Study away your life. Search the Scriptures and without the Holy Spirit opening up our minds and our hearts, we will search these Scriptures in vain. 

Even when you see contradictions... take Romans 4 and James 2. You know where I am going with this. Paul quotes Genesis 15.

>Romans 4:3 (CSB) For what does the Scripture say? Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness.

What does James say? On the surface, it seems he is countering what Paul is saying:

>James 2:22-24 (CSB) You see that faith was active together with his works, and by works, faith was made complete, and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness, and he was called God’s friend. You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.

Paul would not have been offended but he would have agreed. "Yes, James..."

>Ephesians 2:10 (CSB) For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared ahead of time for us to do.

Luke chimes in:

>Acts 17:25 (CSB) Neither is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives everyone life and breath and all things.

We are not saved by doing good works. But when we are saved, we do good works for our neighbor. Remember the words of Christ:

>Matthew 22:37-39 (CSB) He said to him, “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the greatest and most important command. The second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself.

The second is like it. You love God? Love your neighbor. John agrees:

>1 John 4:20-21 (CSB) If anyone says, “I love God,” and yet hates his brother or sister, he is a liar. For the person who does not love his brother or sister whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen. And we have this command from him: The one who loves God must also love his brother and sister.

When it seems we have stumbled upon an apparent contradiction, be humble. You and I ain't the first. Don't you think when TODO: the council canonized the 66 books, that they didn't already think of that? It is the hubris of the modern person to think that we caught something that the early church totally whiffed on.

Is it that they completely missed it or is it the possibility that we have over 2,000 years of Christ building his church to which the gates of hell will not withstand? And that generation after generation stood fast die even to the point of torture and death for this truth--this knowledge of salvation, faith, and obedience.

We don't have to change one word or idea. When we come upon something that is out of sorts, we must remember we are not the first and we must remember the entire character of God Almighty.

3\. Try to remove the Bible, the Bible lives forever

>Isaiah 55:10 (CSB) For just as rain and snow fall from heaven and do not return there without saturating the earth and making it germinate and sprout, and providing seed to sow and food to eat,

>Matthew 4:4 (CSB) He answered, “It is written: Man must not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.”

Burn all Bibles and delete the entire Bible from the internet. Guess what? You can't eradicate it. The Bible does not come from man but from God. 

>Romans 10:17 (CSB) So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the message about Christ.

We will still be saved by the message about Christ. The Bible will never die because God is the God of the everlasting.

Here's the first point and the last point:

4\. **All saving knowledge comes from the scriptures alone** - what's does the scriptures say? there is no other name by which we are saved; here is the gospel:

For here is love:

>Genesis 3:15  
>I will put enmity between you and the woman,  
>and between your offspring and her offspring;  
>he shall bruise your head,  
>and you shall bruise his heel.

And here is love:

>Deuteronomy 7:6-8 “For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth. It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the LORD set his love on you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples, but it is because the LORD loves you and is keeping the oath that he swore to your fathers, that the LORD has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.

And here is love:

>Psalm 103:15-18 As for man, his days are like grass; he flourishes like a flower of the field; for the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and its place knows it no more. But the steadfast love of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him, and his righteousness to children’s children, to those who keep his covenant and remember to do his commandments.

And here is love:

>Ezekiel 36:22-28 And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, that they may walk in my statutes and keep my rules and obey them. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.

And here is love:

>Matthew 1:21 She shall bare a son and you shall call his name Jesus for He will save His people from their sins

And here is love:

>John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.

And here is love:

>Romans 5:8 but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

And here is love:

>2 Corinthians 5:21 For our sake, He made Him to be sin who knew no sin so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.

And here is love:

>Romans 9:25-26  
>… Those who were not my people I will call ‘my people,’  
>and her who was not beloved I will call ‘beloved.’  
>And in the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’  
>there they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’

And here is love:

>Galatians 2:20 I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.

And here is love:

>Romans 8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.

And here is love:

>Romans 8:38-39 For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

And... 

>1 John 4:10 In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.**

Don't you know that the tax collector, who heard the ordinary preaching of the gospel, he was cut to the heart! He stood off and away from the gathered church, would not dare raise his eyes to the Triune but he beat his chest and cried out, "**GOD HAVE MERCY ON ME, A SINNER!** (Luke 18:13)

Not for a moment did the tax collector try to change the words of God. He heard the law and he was found wanting. He truly saw himself for the first time because God opened his eyes for the first time.

He called upon the God who just in wrath--but the only God poured out his saving mercies every day--never ceasing:

>Lamentations 3:22-24 (CSB)  
>Because of the LORD’s faithful love  
>we do not perish,  
>for his mercies never end.  
>They are new every morning;  
>great is your faithfulness!  
>I say, “The LORD is my portion,  
>therefore I will put my hope in him.”

The tax collector knew this. You know this. And I know this.

These things were written, in this Bible, all 66 books, containing saving knowledge of God, so that you and my joy may be complete. (1 John 1:4)
