>Matthew 4:4 (CSB) He answered, “It is written: Man must not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.”

## The Intro

Today, we are going to answer some basic questions about the Bible:

- What is the Bible?
- What does the Bible contain?
- How did we get the Bible?
- Last and certainly not least, so what?

"So what?" I could stand here and give you a bunch of trivia facts about the Bible. What I want for you and me to come away from today's conference is to answer the question, "So what? What does all of that have to do with me?"

## What is the Bible?

### 1689.1.1 On the Holy Scriptures

**The Holy Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible rule of all saving knowledge, faith, and obedience, although the light of nature, and the works of creation and providence do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as to leave men inexcusable; yet are they not sufficient to give that knowledge of God and his will which is necessary unto salvation. Therefore it pleased the Lord at sundry times and in divers manners to reveal himself, and to declare that his will unto his church; and afterward for the better preserving and propagating of the truth, and for the more sure establishment and comfort of the church against the corruption of the flesh, and the malice of Satan, and of the world, to commit the same wholly unto writing; which maketh the Holy Scriptures to be most necessary, those former ways of God's revealing his will unto his people being now ceased.**

## What is in the Bible?

### 1689.1.2 The Old & New Testament of the Holy Scriptures

**Under the name of Holy Scripture, or the Word of God written, are now contained all the books of the Old and New Testaments, which are these:**

**OF THE OLD TESTAMENT: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, I Samuel, II Samuel, I Kings, II Kings, I Chronicles, II Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, The Song of Solomen, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations,Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi**

**All of which are given by the inspiration of God, to be the rule of faith and life.**

### 1689.1.3 On The Apocrypha of the Holy Scriptures

**The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration, are no part of the canon or rule of the Scripture, and, therefore, are of no authority to the church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved or made use of than other human writings.**


## How did we receive this Bible?

### 1689.1.8 On the Inspiration of the Holy Scriptures

**The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of the people of God of old), and the New Testament in Greek (which at the time of the writing of it was most generally known to the nations), being immediately inspired by God, and by his singular care and providence kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentic; so as in all controversies of religion, the church is finally to appeal to them. But because these original tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have a right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded in the fear of God to read and search them, therefore they are to be translated into the vulgar language of every nation unto which they come, that the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship him in an acceptable manner, and through patience and comfort of the Scriptures may have hope.**

## So what?

1. Confidence despite apparent contradictions - natural min vs super natural mind - early church fathers canonized these scriptures even with James contradicting Paul.  Rom 4 - James 2 - Eph 2:8-10

2. Isaiah 55:11 & Matt 4:4 - burn all bibles and delete the entire Bible.  Jesus Christ is the same forever 

3. All saving knowledge comes from the scriptures alone - what's does the scriptures say? there is no other name by which we are saved; here is the gospel x10 

>Luke 18:13 (CSB) “But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even raise his eyes to heaven but kept striking his chest and saying, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner! ’

>Lamentations 3:22-24 (CSB)  
>Because of the LORD’s faithful love  
>we do not perish,  
>for his mercies never end.  
>They are new every morning;  
>great is your faithfulness!  
>I say, “The LORD is my portion,  
>therefore I will put my hope in him.”
