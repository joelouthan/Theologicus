## The Text

>Matthew 4:4 (CSB) He answered, “It is written: Man must not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.”

## The Intro

In an CNN Red Chair Interview, Richard Dawkins was asked what would he say if he met God after his death:

>What's going to happen when I die, if I met god in the unlikely event after I died, I think the first thing I would say is well, which one are you? Are you Zeus? Are you Thor? Are you Baal? Are you Mithras? Are you Yahweh? Which god are you?

I think that answer is  a bit peculiar, to say the least. Joking aside, I suspect what he really wants to say when he stands before the Almighty God, maker of heaven and earth is this question:

>And why did you take such great pains to conceal yourself and to hide away from us? 
>
> Richard Dawkins. CNN Red Chair Interview. September 5, 2012. [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/videos/living/2012/09/05/orig-red-chair-richard-dawkins.cnn)

But God did not hide himself. Not even close. 

I would even give Mr. Dawkins a fair shake if Christ came into our world as a nobody and left as a nobody and then all of sudden, over the course of time, myth after myths started coming up about man who taught about loving your neighbor and be kind to everyone and then, because of a corrupt justice system, was wrongfully tried and executed.

Christ came in as a nobody, this is true. But his life--particularly his ministry, his perfec work, his death on the cross, his resurrection from actual death to actual life, and his ascension to the right hand of the Almighty God the Father--was far, far from ordinary and quiet. His appearance--his existance with his creation changed all of history for all time.

It pleased the Father by the power of the Spirit to change the course of human history in such a way as this: to reveal God in the flesh--his only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, Son of God who is God:

>John 1:14–18 (CSB) The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. We observed his glory, the glory as the one and only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. (John testified concerning him and exclaimed, “This was the one of whom I said, ‘The one coming after me ranks ahead of me, because he existed before me.’ ”)

Yet, the entire basis of the Jewish faith prophesied that this was to be start. Starting with Genesis and ending with Malachi. Over 200 prophecies about the upcoming Messiah:

>Indeed, we have all received grace upon grace from his fullness, for the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.

Jesus Christ is the greatest historical individual in all of history. All of humankind--you, me, and Mr. Dawkins included, are without excuse to believe and trust in the one whom God sent for us. Despite having the moral law of  God has written upon our hearts, we have all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. By that very broken born sin nature and by the sins we commit, we try to suppress the fact that  God exist! We would dare stand before the God who knitted us in our mother's womb and ask "Are you Odin? Are you Allah?" We are born suppressing this truth to the point of sounding as foolish as the day we were born. And we suppress this truth to do what?  So that we can do sin more--so that we can do what is right in our own eyes. That is our natural born state.

But God, fully perfect, fully good, fully holy, and fully merciful and love, did this one blessed and wonderful thing: he sent his only begotten Son.

And for all the atheism and agnosticism and suppression of the truth that the sons of Adam try to come up with, there is no one in their right mind can deny the historical Jesus of Nazareth. You wouldn't just be denying the Bible (that is easy enough) but you would be denying the historical records of the greatest empire of all time: the Greco-Roman Empire. Deny that Jesus ever existed and you would look like a fool.

>John 1:18 (CSB) No one has ever seen God. The one and only Son, who is himself God and is at the Father’s side—he has revealed him.

God did reveal himself. He sent his precious Son to live and die and save his people from their sins. (Matthew 1:21)

And how do we know this to be sure? Furthermore, how do we know this and believe in him and trust in him so that we may not perish in our sins but have everlasting life?

Because, we have the Holy Scriptures. We have the message about the Christ. We have the Bible.

This is why the first chapter of the 1689 Second London Baptist Confession starts off the only source of our saving knowledge, faith, and obedience to the Christ who loved me and gave himself up for me. (Galatians 2:20)

Today, in our first session of today's inaugural RTC mini conference, we are going to answer some basic questions about the Bible:

- Where does the Bible come from? In other words, what is the source of the words in this book?
- Second, what does the Bible contain?
- Next, what is the Bible about and what is it for? What is the purpose of the Bible?
- Lastly and certainly not least, so what?

"So what?" I could stand here and give you a bunch of trivia facts about the Bible. But what I want for you and me to come away from today's conference is to answer the question, "So what? What does the Bible mean for me as an adopted child of God?"

## Where does the Bible come from? What is the source?

### 1689.1.8 On the Inspiration of the Holy Scriptures

**The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of the people of God of old), and the New Testament in Greek (which at the time of the writing of it was most generally known to the nations), being immediately inspired by God, and by His singular care and providence kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentic; so as in all controversies of religion, the church is finally to appeal to them. But because these original tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have a right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded in the fear of God to read, and search them, therefore they are to be translated into the vulgar language of every nation unto which they come, that the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship Him in an acceptable manner, and through patience and comfort of the Scriptures may have hope.**

>2 Timothy 3:16-17 (CSB)
All Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching, for rebuking, for correcting, for training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.

>Matthew 4:4 (CSB) He answered, “It is written: Man must not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.”

- The words contained in this Bible, in the order that they were put together, constructed to form complete and coherent thoughts, ideas, statements, instructions, and proclamations come directly from and inspired by the Almighty God himself.
- That it please the Father in different times, through the power of the Spirit, to inspire authors to write about his only begotten Son, Jesus Christ.
- And to that end, it is the original manuscripts that the confession declares to be infallible and inerrant--that is, without mistakes nor errors.
- have you ever thought about that? The Confession is not saying "every copy of the original manuscripts and every translation is considered to be inerrant and infallible--just the original."
- The copies that were made from the original manuscripts will have slight differences between the copies of the Scriptures but none of them disagree with each other and rightfully support one another when it comes to doctrine, theology, law and the gospel.
- So to that end, the translations, by and large can be trusted. Your NIV contains the law and the gospel. Your KJV masterfully recites the Psalms. Your NASB tries its best to translate from the original languages word for word. Your ESV takes that word for word and makes that a bit more readable. The CSB takes its one step further and takes away the odd word pacing of the ESV and strives for even a greater readability.
- Faithful translations in and of themselves are not infallible and inerrant. They do contain miniscule differences and minor errors
- Food for thought:  on the subject of infallibility and inerrancy of the word of God, I often think of the British theologian, Lesslie Newbigin (1908-1998) said this about it: "Are the Scriptures inerrant and infallible? Those kind of questions come from the modern mind which is asking if this supernatural text is without mistakes or errors. To which the Bible has no answer to wrong questions. But I can look to the Bible and see that the Bible is perfect, trustworthy, right, radiant, pure, reliable, more desirable than gold, sweeter than honey and the drippings of the honeycomb." (Psalm 19)
- That a freebie. You're welcome.
- So to that end, all the copies and all the faithful translations can be trusted because all points of the Christian doctrine and theology, law, gospel of Christ--are all in sync with one another
- in other words, there isn't a copy of the Scriptures or reliable translation. out there, ever in existence that allows a sin not to be a sin. Or worst still, we somehow got the gospel wrong.
  - Neither, "Oopsies, homosexuality is permissable by the Holy God" -or-
  - "Oh, I am sorry, I was so mistaken--we actually have to break our backs to earn the love and grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. Silly me."
- Do sinful men and women, who are steeped and filled with wickedness, arrogance and hubris, still try to twist Scriptures and come out with translations that are unfaithful to the original texts? Yes. Look up the Slave Bible. Look up the New World Translation. Look up the Book of Mormon. All of that work was completely blasphemous, demonic and wholly antichrist. And they, like all the wickedness in this world, will pass away. Why? Because we have the words of Christ, who is the head of church, and the speaker of this word, is the same yesterday, today, and forever.

## What is the Bible?

*What does the Bible contain?*

### 1689.1.2 The Old & New Testament of the Holy Scriptures

**Under the name of Holy Scripture, or the Word of God written, are now contained all the books of the Old and New Testaments, which are these:**

**OF THE OLD TESTAMENT: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, I Samuel, II Samuel, I Kings, II Kings, I Chronicles, II Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, The Song of Solomen, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations,Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi**

**OF THE NEW TESTAMENT: Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, The Acts of the Apostles, Paul's Epistle to the Romans, I Corinthians, II Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, I Thessalonians, II Thessalonians, I Timothy, II Timothy, To Titus, To Philemon, The Epistle to the Hebrews, Epistle of James, The first and second Epistles of Peter, The first, second, and third Epistles of John, The Epistle of Jude, The Revelation**

**All of which are given by the inspiration of God, to be the rule of faith and life.**

- From the Old to the New Testament, from Genesis to Revelation, never forget, all of the Scriptures are about the Lord Jesus Christ. For it is Christ, the Son of God who is God said:

>John 5:39 (CSB) You pore over the Scriptures because you think you have eternal life in them, and yet they testify about me.

- It has been said, rightfully so, that the Old Testament is Christ concealed and the New Testament is Christ revealed.
- Why is that a true saying?
- Go and do a word search in the OLd Testament: look up "Jesus" or "Christ". What are you going to find? Zero items found. Why? Because the Old Testament simply prophesies, foreshadows, mentions, alludes to a Messiah who will destroy the works of Satan and will save sinful men like me. 
- The Old Testament is where God will call upon ordinary people and give them grace to extraordinary things. And as spectacular as the stories of Noah, Abraham, Ruth or King David, they were not the Christ.
- You see bits and parts.
- You hear the promises and covenants, building up on top of the other
- but what was the end goal? 
- so that when the people of God had God in the flesh in their existence, they would not deny the truth but believe that Jesus is the Holy One of God.
- Listen, in order for them to believe, they will need the work of the Holy Spirit--but I will get to that in a moment.

To sum up the books of the Bible, let me give you a pro tip: If you are digging in the Bible hoping for eternal life, then pay attention to what the Bible is actually saying, "Look to the Christ!":

>John 3:14–15 (CSB) “Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.

### 1689.1.3 On The Apocrypha of the Holy Scriptures

**The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration, are no part of the canon or rule of the Scripture, and, therefore, are of no authority to the church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved or made use of than other human writings.**

- Quote from Sproul's "Truths We Confess" - "It's worth the read like any good piece of literature. But divinely inspired, it is not."

William Perkins in his wonderful book, "The Art of Prophesying and the Calling of the Ministry," (while not explicitly linked to the Confession, it is a great little read that pairs well in teaching parts of the Confession) puts it succinctly on the Apocrypha:

- They were not written by the prophets
- They were not written in Hebrew
- In the New Testament, neither Christ nor the apostles appeal to the testimony of those books
- They include false teaching which is contrary to the Scriptures[^perkins-apocrypha]

We know where the Bible comes from--God. We know what the Bible contains--66 divinely inspired books that point to the Christ.

## What is in the Bible?

*What is the Bible about?*

### 1689.1.1 On the Holy Scriptures

**The Holy Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible rule of all saving knowledge, faith, and obedience, although the light of nature, and the works of creation and providence do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as to leave men inexcusable; yet they are not sufficient to give that knowledge of God and His will which is necessary unto salvation. Therefore it pleased the Lord at sundry times and in diversified manners to reveal Himself, and to declare (that) His will unto His church; and afterward for the better preserving and propagating of the truth, and for the more sure establishment and comfort of the church against the corruption of the flesh, and the malice of Satan, and of the world, to commit the same wholly unto writing; which makes the Holy Scriptures to be most necessary, those former ways of God's revealing His will unto His people being now completed.**

- Well-known Evangelical author Gary Thomas in his book Sacred Pathways. Made notice of the personality types of the worshippers of God. Some in music. Some in art. Some in nature. Some in the study.
- Of course, in whatever we do, we must do so to to glory of God (1 Corinthians 10:31)

- there are so many things given to all of mankind by the hand of God that certain reveals that there is a creator and he is sovereign over all of his creation
- but no matter how many sunsets, trees, rivers, or Grand Canyons; infinite data and all the books in the world; endless music and creation of art--will not get you one inch closer into the saving arms of the Lord Jesus Christ.
- all of these good thing are from a great God but they are pale in comparison to the loveliness of our only, only Lord Jesus Christ.
- how are we are saved by God--that is saving knowledge, faith, and obedience--can only be found in the Scriptures. No exception.
- Modern mindset tends to do two things when confronted with that truth:
  - the reduction of the Bible as yet-another-piece-of-literature akin to The Lord of the Rings, Autobiography of Malcolm X or even the Quran--"How can you say that the Bible is so much different that any of religious text or fictional myths and fables and tall tales?"
    - Books like the Lord of Rings come from the creativity of man
    - Biographies like Malcolm X tell about the life of a person who lived
    - Religious texts like Quran are demonic inspired and are not from the God of the Bible (Deuteronomy 32:16–17; 1 Corinthians 10:20; 1 Timothy 4:1)
  - "How can you be so sure? What if a person cannot read?" You mean like 99% of the people mentioned in the pages of the Bible? The printing press was invented over 500 years ago. How did people come upon the saving knowledge, faith, and obedience of God when they could not read and was not wealthy enough to own written materials? Ordinary means of grace--the preaching of the word of God. Preaching is not an new thing. It is an ancient thing going all the way back to God preaching the law in Genesis 2 and proclaiming the gospel in Genesis 3
- yet, in all of that, from the mouth of God to the opened ears of believers, it pleased the Lord at various times to reveal himself in his word, the Holy Scriptures, through 40 plus authors that making up the 66 books of the Bible.

Now we have some of the fact, that just leaves one question to be answered:

## So what?

So what? That's all well and good. If I trust and believe in Jesus, what does that mean for me?

1\. **Confidence despite the urge to downgrade or eliminate laws** -- we are at a place in time where the world and even some Christians are so desperate to get the law of God to make it mean what he so plainly says. 

Just to give an stunning example, you have heard this, "Jesus never talked about marriage."

I remember the first time I heard that. I remember the 100th time I heard that. I was dumbfounded. I awestruck. What do you say to someone who has little or no knowledge of the word of God.

>Matthew 19:4-6 (CSB) “Haven’t you read,” he replied, “that he who created them in the beginning made them male and female, and he also said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh’? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one separate.”

It's right there. Clear as a bell. You and I see this as, "that's the answer!" Here's one response I got: "Well, Jesus didn't say it is *not* not between man and man or woman and woman."

Come now, Lord Jesus.

The same infallible, same perfect Scriptures that Christ himself equates as "the mouth of God" (Matthew 4:4) contains the same laws of God that demands our perfection in order for us to be with God. So, my question to those who want the Bible to not to mean what it says: why do you want to change the Scriptures? Do you want to be with God? We could be in line with numerous wicked people who attempted to change the Bible for our own ill-gotten gains. But us changing a copy of or a translation--changing  one dot one tittle of the law will not save us. You are trying to change the law of God which wasn't going to save us in the first place. Eternal life is not found in the Scriptures but the One whom the Scriptures once concealed now revealed to be the Savior of the world--that is Jesus Christ.

- To save ourselves from death and damnation, we need to fulfill the law. - What did James said, "Break one law and we break them all."
- Who is going to save us?
- It is the same infallible, same perfect Scriptures that contain the law of God that also gives us a plan of salvation. Trust in one who both gives us the law but perfectly obeyed the law and fulfilled the law. His name is Jesus Christ. Call upon his name and you will be saved.

It is the exact same Bible that tells us how infinitely far we are in our depravity and what the Infinite God did to save us from our sins.

2\. **Confidence despite apparent contradictions** - Despite written with the minds and hands of human authors, their inspiration did not come from within their IQ, schooling, EQ, creative talents or even their command of their written language--although, all of that is factored into the word we have today. No, all Scripture is inspired and breathed out by the Holy Spirit:

>2 Timothy 3:16–17 (CSB) All Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching, for rebuking, for correcting, for training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.

This word--these Scriptures are outside of our world. They are completely and wholly supernatural. Go to all the Christian schools. Study away your life. Search the Scriptures and without the Holy Spirit opening up our minds and our hearts, we will search these Scriptures in vain. 

Even when you read the Bible and see apparent contradictions... I will give you the biggest contradiction: take Romans 4 and James 2. You know where I am going with this. Paul quotes Genesis 15.

>Romans 4:3 (CSB) For what does the Scripture say? Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness.

What does James say? On the surface, it seems he is countering what Paul is saying:

>James 2:22-24 (CSB) You see that faith was active together with his works, and by works, faith was made complete, and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness, and he was called God’s friend. You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.

The modern man will go "Ah ha! Look! James is contradicts Paul!" But oh Au contraire mon frère! Let me submit to you that Paul would not have been offended but he would have wholeheartedly  agreed. I am not making this up! "Yes, James..."

>Ephesians 2:10 (CSB) For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared ahead of time for us to do.

Luke chimes in:

>Acts 17:25 (CSB) Neither is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives everyone life and breath and all things.

We are not saved by doing good works. But when we are saved, we do good works for our neighbor. Remember the words of Christ:

>Matthew 22:37-39 (CSB) He said to him, “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the greatest and most important command. The second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself.

The second is like it. You love God? Love your neighbor. John agrees:

>1 John 4:20-21 (CSB) If anyone says, “I love God,” and yet hates his brother or sister, he is a liar. For the person who does not love his brother or sister whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen. And we have this command from him: The one who loves God must also love his brother and sister.

When it seems we have stumbled upon an apparent contradiction, be humble. You and I ain't the first to see this. Don't you think when when the early church fathers canonized the 66 books, that they didn't already think of that? It is the hubris of the modern person to think that we caught something that the early church totally whiffed on.

Is it that they completely missed it or is it the possibility that we have over 2,000 years of Christ building his church to which the gates of hell will not withstand? And that generation after generation stood fast, even to the point of torture and death for this one truth--the Holy Scriptures that contain knowledge of salvation, faith, and obedience unto God.

We don't have to change one word or idea in this book. When we come upon something that is out of sorts, we must remember we are not the first and we must remember the entire character of God Almighty.

3\. Try to remove the Bible, the Bible lives forever

>Isaiah 55:10 (CSB) For just as rain and snow fall from heaven and do not return there without saturating the earth and making it germinate and sprout, and providing seed to sow and food to eat,

Burn all Bibles and delete the entire Bible from the internet. Guess what? You can't eradicate it. The Bible does not come from man but from God. 

>Romans 10:17 (CSB) So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the message about Christ.

We will still be saved by the message about Christ. The Bible will never die because God is the God of the everlasting.

Here's the first point and the last point:

4\. **All saving knowledge comes from the scriptures alone** - what's does the scriptures say? there is no other name by which we are saved; here is the gospel:

For here is love:

>Genesis 3:15  
>I will put enmity between you and the woman,  
>and between your offspring and her offspring;  
>he shall bruise your head,  
>and you shall bruise his heel.

And here is love:

>Deuteronomy 7:6-8 “For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth. It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the LORD set his love on you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples, but it is because the LORD loves you and is keeping the oath that he swore to your fathers, that the LORD has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.

And here is love:

>Psalm 103:15-18 As for man, his days are like grass; he flourishes like a flower of the field; for the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and its place knows it no more. But the steadfast love of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him, and his righteousness to children’s children, to those who keep his covenant and remember to do his commandments.

And here is love:

>Ezekiel 36:22-28 And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, that they may walk in my statutes and keep my rules and obey them. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.

And here is love:

>Matthew 1:21 She shall bare a son and you shall call his name Jesus for He will save His people from their sins

And here is love:

>John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.

And here is love:

>Romans 5:8 but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

And here is love:

>2 Corinthians 5:21 For our sake, He made Him to be sin who knew no sin so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.

And here is love:

>Romans 9:25-26  
>… Those who were not my people I will call ‘my people,’  
>and her who was not beloved I will call ‘beloved.’  
>And in the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’  
>there they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’

And here is love:

>Galatians 2:20 I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.

And here is love:

>Romans 8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.

And here is love:

>Romans 8:38-39 For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

And... 

>1 John 4:10 In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.**

Don't you know that the tax collector, who heard the ordinary preaching of the gospel, he was cut to the heart! He stood off and away from the gathered church, would not dare raise his eyes to the Triune but he beat his chest and cried out, "**GOD HAVE MERCY ON ME, A SINNER!** (Luke 18:13)

We all know the story of the Pharisee and the tax collector. The Pharisee thanks God that he is not like this tax collector. How did the tax collector respond? Not for a moment did the tax collector try to change the words of God. He heard the law and he was found lacking--falling infinitely short of the infinite glory of God. He truly saw himself as a sinner for the first time because for the first time in his life, God opened his eyes.

How did he respond? Trying to trip up the omniscient, all wise and all good God with contradictions? No! He had nowhere else to go. He called upon the God who pours out his saving mercies every single day:

>Lamentations 3:22-24 (CSB)  
>Because of the LORD’s faithful love  
>we do not perish,  
>for his mercies never end.  
>They are new every morning;  
>great is your faithfulness!  
>I say, “The LORD is my portion,  
>therefore I will put my hope in him.”

The tax collector knew this. You know this. And I know this.

These things were written, in this Bible, all 66 books, containing saving knowledge of God, so that our joy may be complete. (1 John 1:4)

Amen.
