## The Text

>1 Corinthians 9:7-12 (CSB) Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its fruit? Or who shepherds a flock and does not drink the milk from the flock? Am I saying this from a human perspective? Doesn’t the law also say the same thing? For it is written in the law of Moses, Do not muzzle an ox while it treads out grain. Is God really concerned about oxen? Isn’t he really saying it for our sake? Yes, this is written for our sake, because he who plows ought to plow in hope, and he who threshes should thresh in hope of sharing the crop. If we have sown spiritual things for you, is it too much if we reap material benefits from you? If others have this right to receive benefits from you, don’t we even more? Nevertheless, we have not made use of this right; instead, we endure everything so that we will not hinder the gospel of Christ.

## The Chapter

**The work of pastors being constantly to attend the service of Christ, in his churches, in the ministry of the word and prayer, with watching for their souls, as they that must give an account to Him; it is incumbent on the churches to whom they minister, not only to give them all due respect, but also to communicate to them of all their good things according to their ability, so as they may have a comfortable supply, without being themselves entangled in secular affairs; and may also be capable of exercising hospitality towards others; and this is required by the law of nature, and by the express order of our Lord Jesus, who hath ordained that they that preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel.**

## The Confession

### The work of pastors being constantly to attend the service of Christ, in his churches, in the ministry of the word and prayer, with watching for their souls, as they that must give an account to Him

>Acts 6:4 (CSB) But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.”

>Hebrews 13:17 (CSB) Obey your leaders and submit to them, since they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account, so that they can do this with joy and not with grief, for that would be unprofitable for you.

This is the work of the minister--those who God calls, senses that calling, and finally being tested and accept by the local to church to "keep watch over our souls" (Hebrews 13:17).

To the minister, the primary cornerstone of their work is in the ministry of the preaching of the word of God. And I am not here to tell you what is does not include. We are smart, sensible folk. Your pastor's main focus in his work is preaching the word of God--which Christ himself equates as "the mouth of God". (Matthew 4:4)

God even gave us deacons to tend ot other ministries within the local church so that elders can go back to preaching the word. (Acts 6)

Do this well and everything else will sort it self out.

The minister is not to be a business leader nor even a licensed counselor. He is, primarily, a preaching and proclaimer of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

### it is incumbent on the churches to whom they minister, not only to give them all due respect, but also to communicate to them of all their good things according to their ability

>1 Timothy 5:17–18 (CSB) The elders who are good leaders are to be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching. For the Scripture says: Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain, and, The worker is worthy of his wages.

>Galatians 6:6–7 (CSB) Let the one who is taught the word share all his good things with the teacher. Don’t be deceived: God is not mocked. For whatever a person sows he will also reap,

To those whom God and the congregant has placed in charge of them, we are to doubly honor them. This 1 Timothy 5:17-18 passage is a call, to the best of the congregant's ability, to financially support their pastor who "especially... works hard at preaching and teaching."

I understand that there are certain circumstances where the church might not be able to support their pastor in the way they want. But, by and large, do seek that goal of supporting your pastors.

### so as they may have a comfortable supply, without being themselves entangled in secular affairs

>2 Timothy 2:4 (CSB) No one serving as a soldier gets entangled in the concerns of civilian life; he seeks to please the commanding officer.

I speak as a member of a church, whom, for the first time in 10 years, we are able to nearly support our lead pastor. Praise be to God. But previously, my pastor had to work a grueling job cleaning boilers in another state for several days out of the week. Do you think that he was able to do the job of a minister particular well while being in another state during the week. Only only by God's grace could he shepherd and minister the word of God. Praise God that he had other elders to help shepherd the flock.

### and may also be capable of exercising hospitality towards others

>1 Timothy 3:2 (CSB) An overseer, therefore, must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, self-controlled, sensible, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,

This will look different between pastors and the capability of their home but be hospitable. What does that look like? That is up for your pastor to decide. I cannot give you extra-biblical rules to have your pastor abide by them. But whatever is in his capacity, do so.

### and this is required by the law of nature, and by the express order of our Lord Jesus, who has ordained that they that preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel

>1 Corinthians 9:6–14 (CSB) Or do only Barnabas and I have no right to refrain from working? Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its fruit? Or who shepherds a flock and does not drink the milk from the flock? Am I saying this from a human perspective? Doesn’t the law also say the same thing? For it is written in the law of Moses, Do not muzzle an ox while it treads out grain. Is God really concerned about oxen? Isn’t he really saying it for our sake? Yes, this is written for our sake, because he who plows ought to plow in hope, and he who threshes should thresh in hope of sharing the crop. If we have sown spiritual things for you, is it too much if we reap material benefits from you? If others have this right to receive benefits from you, don’t we even more? Nevertheless, we have not made use of this right; instead, we endure everything so that we will not hinder the gospel of Christ. Don’t you know that those who perform the temple services eat the food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in the offerings of the altar? In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should earn their living by the gospel.

This is the natural law: if you preach the gospel, you must live the gospel. We have seen countless ministers permanently disqualify themselves because while they certainly preach the gospel, they did not live the gospel.

They, and we, should be reminded continuously that the gospel is the power of God in salvation just for those who believe. For in it, the righteousness of God is revealed--from faith to faith--for as it is written, "the righteous shall live by faith!" (Romans 1:16-17)

The righteous shall live by faith. The preachers of the gospel should live by the gospel.

And we forget the gospel continuously because even as the strongest believes in Christ, we fail and sin continuously. All the time. 

How can we be reminded of the gospel?

Every week, come to church on the Lord's Day and hear the double-honored minister preach the only thing that you and I need: the gospel of Jesus Christ.
