# 13.2 What God Does: The Christ Lived and Died for Us

## The Text

>Romans 7:14–21 (CSB)  
><sup>14</sup> For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh, sold as a slave under sin. 
>
><sup>15</sup> For I do not understand what I am doing, because I do not practice what I want to do, but I do what I hate. 
>
><sup>16</sup> Now if I do what I do not want to do, I agree with the law that it is good. 
>
><sup>17</sup> So now I am no longer the one doing it, but it is sin living in me. 
>
><sup>18</sup> For I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh. For the desire to do what is good is with me, but there is no ability to do it. 
>
><sup>19</sup> For I do not do the good that I want to do, but I practice the evil that I do not want to do. 
>
><sup>20</sup> Now if I do what I do not want, I am no longer the one that does it, but it is the sin that lives in me. 
>
><sup>21</sup> So I discover this law: When I want to do what is good, evil is present with me. 

## The Chapter

This sanctification is throughout the whole man, yet imperfect in this life; there abides still some remnants of corruption in every part, wherefrom arises a continual and irreconcilable war; the flesh lusting against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh.

## The Confession

### This sanctification is throughout the whole man

>1 Thessalonians 5:23 (CSB) Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely. And may your whole spirit, soul, and body be kept sound and blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

### yet imperfect in this life; there abides still some remnants of corruption in every part

>Romans 7:18 (CSB) For I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh. For the desire to do what is good is with me, but there is no ability to do it.

>Romans 7:23 (CSB) but I see a different law in the parts of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and taking me prisoner to the law of sin in the parts of my body.

### wherefrom arises a continual and irreconcilable war; the flesh lusting against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh

>Galatians 5:17 (CSB) For the flesh desires what is against the Spirit, and the Spirit desires what is against the flesh; these are opposed to each other, so that you don’t do what you want.

>1 Peter 2:11 (CSB) Dear friends, I urge you as strangers and exiles to abstain from sinful desires that wage war against the soul.
