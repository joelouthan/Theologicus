## The Chapter

**As Christ would have us to be certainly persuaded that there shall be a day of judgment, both to deter all men from sin, and for the greater consolation of the godly in their adversity, so will he have the day unknown to men, that they may shake off all carnal security, and be always watchful, because they know not at what hour the Lord will come, and may ever be prepared to say, Come Lord Jesus; come quickly. Amen.**

## The Confession

>2 Corinthians 5:10–11 (CSB) For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each may be repaid for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil. Therefore, since we know the fear of the Lord, we try to persuade people. What we are is plain to God, and I hope it is also plain to your consciences.

>2 Thessalonians 1:5–7 (CSB) It is clear evidence of God’s righteous judgment that you will be counted worthy of God’s kingdom, for which you also are suffering, since it is just for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you and to give relief to you who are afflicted, along with us. This will take place at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his powerful angels,

>Mark 13:35–37 (CSB) Therefore be alert, since you don’t know when the master of the house is coming—whether in the evening or at midnight or at the crowing of the rooster or early in the morning. Otherwise, when he comes suddenly he might find you sleeping. And what I say to you, I say to everyone: Be alert!”

>Luke 12:35–40 (CSB) “Be ready for service and have your lamps lit. You are to be like people waiting for their master to return from the wedding banquet so that when he comes and knocks, they can open the door for him at once. Blessed will be those servants the master finds alert when he comes. Truly I tell you, he will get ready, have them recline at the table, then come and serve them. If he comes in the middle of the night, or even near dawn, and finds them alert, blessed are those servants. But know this: If the homeowner had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into. You also be ready, because the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.”

### and may ever be prepared to say, Come Lord Jesus; come quickly

So in all of this, what shall I pray?  

What can I say?

I pray to worship You.

I pray to praise Your holy name forever.

I pray to sing to You.

I pray because I want You.

I pray because I need You near.

I pray because I have no life without You.

I pray because You are my Lord and God.

I pray because You are my Father.

I pray because You are my Savior.

I pray because You are the Spirit inside of me.

And this I know, You have declared Your sweets words to be true (Psalm 119). Your words come from Your very breath (2 Timothy 3:16) and they are sufficient—no, more than sufficient—necessary for life. (Genesis 2:7 cf. John 11:43) 

How can I begin to describe the feeling when your sweet words falls upon my ears, eyes, mind and heart?

Psalm 19:7–10 (CSB)  
      The instruction of the LORD is perfect,  
      renewing one’s life;  
      the testimony of the LORD is trustworthy,  
      making the inexperienced wise.  

The precepts of the LORD are right,  
      making the heart glad;  
      the command of the LORD is radiant,  
      making the eyes light up.  

The fear of the LORD is pure,  
      enduring forever;  
      the ordinances of the LORD are reliable  
      and altogether righteous.  

They are more desirable than gold—  
      than an abundance of pure gold;  
      and sweeter than honey  
      dripping from a honeycomb.

If Your promises hold true—if You say You will make all things right despite our folly and sin (Genesis 3:15); if You say You will bear our iniquities and our trespasses (Isaiah 53) and You will draw near to us just when we think You are so far away (Psalm 22), then my life and my love is all in Your Word. I have nowhere else to go and no one else to turn to. 

Who can I trust?  
Where I can seek refuge in?  
Whom have I in heaven but You?  
Is there anyone on earth I desire besides You? (Psalm 73:25)

This much is true: for you are my God. You loved me and you are always mindful of me even before you created time and space. 

You have shown the awesome worth of your love by sending and giving Your precious Son to me.

You have shown the infinite might of your power by giving your Spirit to me.

So what then can I say?

So what then can I do?

All I can do is simply thank you.

So from the bottom of my heart,  
I thank you for giving me strength.   
Thank you my Father God.  
Thank you my Christ Jesus.  
Thank you my Holy Spirit.  
  
You judged me faithful.  
You appointed to Your service.  
Despite my dishonoring and blaspheming,   
 Your holy name,  
despite my persecution and hatred,  
 of those who love you,  
despite my perverted and violent opposition,  
 towards you,  
  
Still  
I only received mercy  
because I was lost  
I was lame  
I was deaf  
I was blind  
I was stupid  
I was ignorant  
I was evil  
I was dead  
and I was not looking and could not look for you whatsoever.  
  
But Your beautiful, sweet and tender   
love, mercy and grace  
overflowed for me  
overwhelmingly  
undeservingly  
ill-deservingly  
with your unbroken faithfulness  
and your relentless love  
that can only be by You,   
for You,   
through You,  
my Christ Jesus my Lord my Savior.  
  
These words  
out of my heart  
are true  
and with all of my hope and dreams   
and desires and wishes  
I pray  
that these words would be sweet to your ears.  
  
I know  
that you came in this world  
to rescue your people  
to pull them out of despair  
to give your people life  
to save them from their sins  
to bring them to you  
evil sinners  
at war with you  
All of us  
And I lead this group.  
I am the foremost  
I am their chief  
I am their victor  
I am their champion of those who would face Your terrifying wrath!  
  
Yet,  
in this reason  
that Your grace abounds all the more  
that Your mercy renews every morning  
that Your love never ceases  
that You  
my Lord and Savior  
Jesus Christ  
might display   
  
Your perfection, beauty, tenderness, quickness,  
Your love, mercy, grace, patience  
for all of those who You call Yours  
and those would believe upon Your holy name for life forever.  
  
This is why I will sing  
to the God of the everlasting to the everlasting  
the Triune  
the Father  
the Son  
the Holy Spirit  
the immortal  
the invisible  
the Only One  
the Creator  
the Sustainer  
the Merciful  
the Peace  
the Grace  
the Faith  
the Messiah  
the Immanuel, God with Us  
the Blessed  
the Living Word  
the Christ  
the Son of God  
the Fellow Heir  
the Second Adam  
the Kinsman Redeemer  
the Beginning  
the Means  
the End  
the Majesty  
the Truth  
the Way  
the Life  
the Wisdom  
the Teacher  
the Rescuer  
the Promise  
the Calling  
the Fulfillment  
the Abundance  
the Host  
the Governor   
the High Priest  
the Prophet  
the Apostle  
the Sufferer  
the Messiah  
the Servant  
the Son of Man  
the Glorified  
the Power  
the Gospel  
the Guide  
the Elector  
the All-Sufficient  
the Lion of Judah  
the Worthy Lamb who was slain  
the King of all kings  
the Lord of all lords  
the Commander  
the Ruler above all  
the Name above all Names  
  
my Holiness  
my Righteousness  
my Justice  
my Faithfulness  
my Mercy  
my Grace  
my Friend  
my Confidence  
my Pastor  
my Elder  
my Brother  
my Assurance  
my Redeemer  
my Rock  
my Salvation  
my All in all  
my Exalted  
my Glorious  
my Beloved  
my Joy  
my Song  
my Love  
  
my Jesus Christ, King, Lord, Savior and Messiah  
my Father, my Father, my Abba, my heart  
my Holy Spirit, my comfort, my peace, my gift, my breath.  
  
 So I will be so very careful to  
worship,  
sing,  
praise,  
glorify,  
exalt,  
proclaim,  
honor,  
dedicate,  
and love   
You alone.  
  
I pray this desperately and joyfully,  
 in the beautiful,   
sweet,   
precious,   
most tender,  
loveliest,  
most worthy,  
dearest name of  
Your Son.  
  
His name is  
the Lord Jesus Christ.  

>Revelation 22:20 (CSB) He who testifies about these things says, “Yes, I am coming soon.” Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!

Yes! Come, Lord Jesus! Right now, come, right now!

Amen!
