# 30.2 Lord's Supper: In Remembrance

## The Text

## The Chapter

So that the popish sacrifice of the mass, as they call it, is most abominable, injurious to Christ's own sacrifice the alone propitiation for all the sins of the elect.

>1 Corinthians 11:24 (CSB) and when he had given thanks, broke it, and said, “This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”

>Matthew 26:26–27 (CSB) As they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, gave it to the disciples, and said, “Take and eat it; this is my body.” Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks, he gave it to them and said, “Drink from it, all of you.
