## The Text

## The Chapter

### God did from all eternity decree to justify all the elect, and Christ did in the fullness of time die for their sins, and rise again for their justification; nevertheless, they are not justified personally, until the Holy Spirit doth in time due actually apply Christ unto them.

## The Confession

### God did from all eternity decree to justify all the elect

>Galatians 3:8 (CSB) Now the Scripture saw in advance that God would justify the Gentiles by faith and proclaimed the gospel ahead of time to Abraham, saying, All the nations will be blessed through you.

>1 Peter 1:2 (CSB) according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to be obedient and to be sprinkled with the blood of Jesus Christ. May grace and peace be multiplied to you.

>1 Timothy 2:6 (CSB) who gave himself as a ransom for all, a testimony at the proper time.

### and Christ did in the fullness of time die for their sins, and rise again for their justification;

>Romans 4:25 (CSB) He was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification.

### nevertheless, they are not justified personally, until the Holy Spirit in time does actually apply Christ to them.

>Colossians 1:21 (CSB) Once you were alienated and hostile in your minds as expressed in your evil actions.

>Colossians 1:22 (CSB) But now he has reconciled you by his physical body through his death, to present you holy, faultless, and blameless before him—

>Titus 3:4–7 (CSB) But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for mankind appeared, he saved us—not by works of righteousness that we had done, but according to his mercy—through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit. He poured out his Spirit on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior so that, having been justified by his grace, we may become heirs with the hope of eternal life.
