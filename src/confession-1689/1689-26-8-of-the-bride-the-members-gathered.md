## The Text

>1 Timothy 3:1–13 (CSB) This saying is trustworthy: “If anyone aspires to be an overseer, he desires a noble work.” An overseer, therefore, must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, self-controlled, sensible, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not an excessive drinker, not a bully but gentle, not quarrelsome, not greedy. He must manage his own household competently and have his children under control with all dignity. (If anyone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of God’s church?) He must not be a new convert, or he might become conceited and incur the same condemnation as the devil. Furthermore, he must have a good reputation among outsiders, so that he does not fall into disgrace and the devil’s trap. Deacons, likewise, should be worthy of respect, not hypocritical, not drinking a lot of wine, not greedy for money, holding the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience. They must also be tested first; if they prove blameless, then they can serve as deacons. Wives, likewise, should be worthy of respect, not slanderers, self-controlled, faithful in everything. Deacons are to be husbands of one wife, managing their children and their own households competently. For those who have served well as deacons acquire a good standing for themselves and great boldness in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.


## The Chapter

**A particular church, gathered and completely organized according to the mind of Christ, consists of officers and members; and the officers appointed by Christ to be chosen and set apart by the church (so called and gathered), for the peculiar administration of ordinances, and execution of power or duty, which he intrusts them with, or calls them to, to be continued to the end of the world, are bishops or elders, and deacons.**

## The Confession

>Acts 20:17–28 (CSB) Now from Miletus, he sent to Ephesus and summoned the elders of the church. When they came to him, he said to them, “You know, from the first day I set foot in Asia, how I was with you the whole time, serving the Lord with all humility, with tears, and during the trials that came to me through the plots of the Jews. You know that I did not hesitate to proclaim anything to you that was profitable and to teach you publicly and from house to house. I testified to both Jews and Greeks about repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus. “And now I am on my way to Jerusalem, compelled by the Spirit, not knowing what I will encounter there, except that in every town the Holy Spirit warns me that chains and afflictions are waiting for me. But I consider my life of no value to myself; my purpose is to finish my course and the ministry I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of God’s grace. “And now I know that none of you, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, will ever see me again. Therefore I declare to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all of you, because I did not avoid declaring to you the whole plan of God. Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has appointed you as overseers, to shepherd the church of God, which he purchased with his own blood.

>Philippians 1:1 (CSB) Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus: To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and deacons.

This particular exposition--I might have to put a pin in it and come back to it. This thought is too personal for me to speak about it. Perhaps, when I have cooled off and I can speak about it in a calmer fashion.

But until then, I will quote Steven J. Lawson, "There needs to be less preachers and pastors, not more. We need to desperately reduce the number of pulpits and combine a lot of churches."

Depending on your church upbringing, if you were like me, who grew up megachurch evangelical, you might be tempted to think that reducing the number of small churches and combining them would be good and proper.

But obviously, megachurches should not be touched because they are doing it right because look at the numbers because might makes right and majority rules.

God looks at none of that.

I cannot speak for small churches but way too many men, mostly who have not been tested against 1 Timothy 3 and Titus 1, were given the title pastor without qualifications--due to gifting or charisma.

But they were never tested so they sin grievously and fall from grace.

We need less pastors not more.

I have never served as a pastor. But I do know what the word says.

I think we should have less pastors not more.

Just pastors who have been tested against Scriptures.
