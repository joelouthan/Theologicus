# 15.3 God Gives More: Spirit

## The Text

>John 3:14–15 (CSB) “Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.

## The Chapter

This saving repentance is an evangelical grace, whereby a person, being by the Holy Spirit made sensible of the manifold evils of his sin, doth, by faith in Christ, humble himself for it with godly sorrow, detestation of it, and self-abhorrency, praying for pardon and strength of grace, with a purpose and endeavour, by supplies of the Spirit, to walk before God unto all well-pleasing in all things.

## The Confession

### This saving repentance is an evangelical grace

>Zechariah 12:10 (CSB) “Then I will pour out a spirit of grace and prayer on the house of David and the residents of Jerusalem, and they will look at me whom they pierced. They will mourn for him as one mourns for an only child and weep bitterly for him as one weeps for a firstborn.

>Acts 11:18 (CSB) When they heard this they became silent. And they glorified God, saying, “So then, God has given repentance resulting in life even to the Gentiles.”

><sup>1</sup> Be gracious to me, God, according to your faithful love; according to your abundant compassion, blot out my rebellion. 
>
><sup>2</sup> Completely wash away my guilt and cleanse me from my sin. 
>
><sup>3</sup> For I am conscious of my rebellion, and my sin is always before me. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Against you—you alone—I have sinned and done this evil in your sight. So you are right when you pass sentence; you are blameless when you judge. 
>
><sup>5</sup> Indeed, I was guilty when I was born; I was sinful when my mother conceived me. 
>
><sup>6</sup> Surely you desire integrity in the inner self, and you teach me wisdom deep within. 
>
><sup>7</sup> Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow. 
>
><sup>8</sup> Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones you have crushed rejoice. 
>
><sup>9</sup> Turn your face away from my sins and blot out all my guilt. 
>
><sup>10</sup> God, create a clean heart for me and renew a steadfast spirit within me. 
>
><sup>11</sup> Do not banish me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me. 
>
><sup>12</sup> Restore the joy of your salvation to me, and sustain me by giving me a willing spirit. 
>
><sup>13</sup> Then I will teach the rebellious your ways, and sinners will return to you. 
>
><sup>14</sup> Save me from the guilt of bloodshed, God— God of my salvation— and my tongue will sing of your righteousness. 
>
><sup>15</sup> Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise. 
>
><sup>16</sup> You do not want a sacrifice, or I would give it; you are not pleased with a burnt offering. 
>
><sup>17</sup> The sacrifice pleasing to God is a broken spirit. You will not despise a broken and humbled heart, God. 
>
><sup>18</sup> In your good pleasure, cause Zion to prosper; build the walls of Jerusalem. 
>
><sup>19</sup> Then you will delight in righteous sacrifices, whole burnt offerings; then bulls will be offered on your altar.
