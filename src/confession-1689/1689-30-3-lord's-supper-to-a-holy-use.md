## The Text

>1 Corinthians 11:23–26 (CSB) For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: On the night when he was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, broke it, and said, “This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, and said, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.

## The Chapter

**The Lord Jesus hath, in this ordinance, appointed his ministers to pray, and bless the elements of bread and wine, and thereby to set them apart from a common to a holy use, and to take and break the bread; to take the cup, and, they communicating also themselves, to give both to the communicants.**

## The Confession

In the past, I have definitely administered communion when I was not ordained by a pastor. Now that I see the Scriptures and this doctrine has been crystallized for me, I would not do that again. Similarly to what I wrote about administration and baptism, [^1] this now becomes a conviction for myself. I would not administer communion unless I was ordained by a pastor.

Reminder that these are my convictions and not necessarily the convictions of other Christians.
