**The Lord Jesus hath, in this ordinance, appointed his ministers to pray, and bless the elements of bread and wine, and thereby to set them apart from a common to a holy use, and to take and break the bread; to take the cup, and, they communicating also themselves, to give both to the communicants.**

This page discusses the ordinance of the Lord's Supper and the role of ministers in its administration. It explains that Jesus appointed His ministers to pray and bless the elements of bread and wine, setting them apart for a holy use, and to distribute them to the communicants. The page includes references to 1 Corinthians 11:23-26 from the Christian Standard Bible (CSB) to support these points.

## The Confession

>1 Corinthians 11:23–26 (CSB) For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: On the night when he was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, broke it, and said, “This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, and said, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.
