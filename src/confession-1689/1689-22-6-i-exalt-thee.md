## The Text

>John 4:21-26 (CSB) Jesus told her, “Believe me, woman, an hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. You Samaritans worship what you do not know. We worship what we do know, because salvation is from the Jews. But an hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in Spirit and in truth. Yes, the Father wants such people to worship him. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in Spirit and in truth.”
>
>The woman said to him, “I know that the Messiah is coming” (who is called Christ). “When he comes, he will explain everything to us.”
>
>Jesus told her, “I, the one speaking to you, am he.”

## The Chapter

**Neither prayer nor any other part of religious worship, is now under the gospel, tied unto, or made more acceptable by any place in which it is performed, or towards which it is directed; but God is to be worshipped everywhere in spirit and in truth; as in private families daily, and in secret each one by himself; so more solemnly in the public assemblies, which are not carelessly nor wilfully to be neglected or forsaken, when God by his word or providence calleth thereunto.**

## The Confession

By no means are we trying to make man-made rules out of Scriptures and then super-impose them on the congregation. Yet, the order of worship locations should be noted.

### Neither prayer nor any other part of religious worship, is now under the gospel, tied unto, or made more acceptable by any place in which it is performed, or towards which it is directed; but God is to be worshipped everywhere in spirit and in truth

>John 4:21 (CSB) Jesus told her, “Believe me, woman, an hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.

>Malachi 1:11 (CSB) “My name will be great among the nations, from the rising of the sun to its setting. Incense and pure offerings will be presented in my name in every place because my name will be great among the nations,” says the LORD of Armies.

>1 Timothy 2:8 (CSB) Therefore, I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or argument.

First and foremost, it is not the building that gives God worship rather, his glory fills the whole earth (Psalm 72:19). There is not a place on earth, in heavens or under the earth where he is not. His presence is always with us. Therefore, being that is true, we are called to worship in spirit and in truth.

### as in private families

>Acts 10:2 (CSB) He was a devout man and feared God along with his whole household. He did many charitable deeds for the Jewish people and always prayed to God.

Christian, this is the call to lead worship in your homes.

Now, I am not under the assumption that every household led by husband and wife or does or does not contain kids. To your situation in particular, whether married or single, kids or no kids, be sure adjust accordingly.

All that said, what is worship to God with our families?

Remember the previous paragraph:

**The reading of the Scriptures, preaching, and hearing the Word of God, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in our hearts to the Lord**

From that, what is ours to do?

- read the Scriptures out loud
- hear the Word of God
- teach and admonish one another in singing
- pray together

What does this look like in my home? I am glad your ask. We are a blended family. I have two children who do not live with me but rather with their mother (whom I am divorced from). 

When they are with me and my wife, we have several options:

- I will walk them through Scriptures--verse by verse. We have gone through the gospels of [Mark](../mark/index.md) and [Luke](../luke/index.md) in this way.

However you do it, and whatever you do it, just do it. Don't be afraid to fail. Just start doing it and get into the rhythm.

### daily

>Matthew 6:11 (CSB) Give us today our daily bread.

>Psalm 55:17 (CSB) I complain and groan morning, noon, and night, and he hears my voice.

To that end, pray prayers. Sing. Read aloud. Do something every day with your family that points and worships God directly.

None of are going to do worship God perfectly and consistently. That is why God sent the Christ for us so that we have an advocate who loves the Lord our God perfectly and loves his neighbor as himself perfectly. 

If we worshipped God perfectly, we would not need the Christ.

### and in secret each one by himself

>Matthew 6:6 (CSB) But when you pray, go into your private room, shut your door, and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.

Personal time. Quiet time. Devotional time. Whatever you want to call it, you life will be better off in the word, praying, and studying.

Don't be dogmatic. You are going to not be consistent. Again, if we consistently obeyed the Father, we would not need the Christ.

### so more solemnly in the public assemblies, which are not carelessly nor wilfully to be neglected or forsaken, when God by his word or providence calls thereunto

>Hebrews 10:25 (CSB) not neglecting to gather together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging each other, and all the more as you see the day approaching.

>Acts 2:42 (CSB) They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching, to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to prayer.

Ah saints. Gather together to hear all of what God has done for us. Come hear the good news! I know you and I have forgotten it because have sinned since the last time we have heard it. We have sin and we need a Savior. We have the Savior! His name is Jesus Christ.

I don't know about anybody else but I actually know more Christians in my parents generation who do not go to church versus those who do. I cannot explain this phenomenon. But it does grieve me to my core.

All I can do is pray and for myself, cannot neglect to gather together. The local church is way too important. Christ died so that we could gather and worship God together--to "**reading of the Scriptures, preaching, and hearing the Word of God, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in our hearts to the Lord**" together.
