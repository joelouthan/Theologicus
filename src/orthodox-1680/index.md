## Dedication

The reprinting of this Catechism is dedicated to all the Christian parents who earnestly desire to fulfill one of the noblest duties given to their life – raising their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. May the Lord bless your labors, according to the riches of His mercy and grace.

## Foreword

I wish to express my gratitude toward a dear Christian brother and friend; pastor Steve Weaver. It was he who first introduced me to this wonderful catechism by Hercules Collins, a seventeenth century Particular Baptist pastor who also was a signer of the 1677/1689 Baptist Confession of faith.[^1]

This catechism, much like the 1689 Baptist Confession and the 1693 Baptist Catechism demonstrates the congeniality that these Baptist Puritans shared with their reformed, protestant contemporaries in the Christian faith. By utilizing the Heidelberg Catechism, Collins remains within the stream of the reformed tradition while expressing his own conviction of believer’s baptism.

It is our desire that this catechism along with the 1689 Baptist Confession of faith and the 1693 Baptist Catechism authored by Williams Collins (no relation to Hercules Collins) would once again be utilized in the evangelizing, teaching and training of the children in our churches and homes. That they would, as in the past, aid our churches in preserving those precious truths that are
“most surely believed amongst us”.

Parents and grandparents, gather the children in your life around, and together explore through the questions and answers offered in the Catechism. Read the proof texts and then add your own as the Spirit leads your time together. Allow me to offer a small bit of advice, be certain to record the date you read and discuss a question, also jot down any additional thoughts or scriptures each child may contribute. This will allow you to observe through the years how they have grown in their understanding of the material. When done daily, a solid and biblical foundation will begin to be established in the hearts and minds of your children. In time and according to God’s plans, they will be equipped to earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.

Your affectionate servant in Christ,

D.W. Barger

## Preface

Unto the Church of Christ, who upon Confession of Faith have been Baptized, Meeting in Old-Gravel Lane London, Grace Mercy and Peace be multiplied unto you, and the good will of him which dwelt in the Bush be with your Spirits, Amen.

Dearly Beloved,

Forasmuch as there is but a small time allotted unto any of us in this World, and not knowing but my staff standeth next the door ready to depart, I am desirous in this respect so to bestow my precious and present time in my Lord's business, as I may not return to him with my talent wrapped up in a napkin, but may leave behind me some poor token and testimony of my love and duty towards Him, and his blessed spouse the Church.

And forasmuch as the day we live in is very gloomy and dark, full of Error and Heresy, which spreads more and more
(through the indefatigable endeavors of the maintainers of it) like an overflowing leprosy, and eateth as doth a canker.

Also considering it is a day of great declension in love to God and one to another also, from those gospel truths, the least of which is more worth then our lives: all which may give God just cause to say to England's Professors, as once to Israel,
“What iniquity have your fathers found in Me that they are gone away far from me? As if God should say, “Am I not the same as ever in Power, Goodness, Faithfulness? is not My Word and Ordinances the same, yea my Promises and Heaven the same now as ever?”

Now that you may not be shaken, shattered and carried away with every wind and blast, every puff and breath of Error, and Heresy; also that you may be the better established, strengthened, and settled on that sure Rock and Foundation of Salvation, Christ's Merits, in opposition to the poor imperfect works of an impotent creature; also settled on the foundation of church-constitution, on which you are already built, through the grace of God which stirred you up to search the divine oracle, and Rule of Divine service, as Ezra and Nehemiah searched into the particular parts of God's worship, by which means they came to the practice of that almost lost ordinance of God, the Feast of Tabernacles, which for many years was not practiced after the due order, though a general notion was retained about it; I say, under these considerations, I have in charitable regard to your souls, presented you with this small (but I am bold to say) sound piece of divinity, which may not unsuitably be styled an abridgment, or epitome[^2] of law and gospel, suited to every ones capacity in God's house. Here is milk for babes, and meat for strong men. It may not unsuitably be compared to the waters of the sanctuary, where some may go up to the ankles, others to the

knees, others to the loins, and they are deep enough for others to swim in. Here you are not only taught to be good Christians, but good moralists, the wane of which among them that have the leaves and lamps of profession (as it is to be feared such have little more) is of a heart-breaking consideration to many that desire to walk with God.

Now albeit here may be many things which some of you may know already, yet unto such those things I hope will be acceptable as St. Peter's epistles were to the scattered Saints, though they knew much of the matter before, yet I dare say here is some things which may be for information as well as establishment to the most knowing among you.

I have not undertaken to present you with new notions or principles, hoping an Athenian Spirit is in none of you, but do believe that an old gospel (to you that have tasted the sweetness of it) will be more acceptable than a new, though published by an angel from Heaven.

In what I have written you will see I concenter with the most orthodox divines in the fundamental principles and articles of the Christian faith, and also have industriously expressed them in the same words, which have on the like occasion been spoken, only differing in some things about church-constitution, wherein I have taken a little pains to show you the true form of God's house, with the coming in thereof, and the going out thereof.

But I hope my zeal in this will not be misinterpreted by any that truly fear God. That God whom we serve is very jealous of his worship; and forasmuch as by His providence the Law of His house hath been preserved and continued to us, we look upon it as our duty in our generation to be searching out the mind of God in His holy oracle, as Ezra and Nehemiah did the feast of Tabernacles, and to reform what is amiss, As Hezekiah, who took a great deal of pains to cleanse the House of God, and set all things in order, that were out of order, particularly caused the people to keep the Passover according to the institution. For it had not, saith the text, been of a long time kept in such sort as it was written. And albeit the pure institutions of Christ were not for some hundreds of years practiced according to the due order, or very little through the innovations of antichrist; and as circumcision for about forty years was unpracticed in the wilderness, yet as Joshua puts this duty in practice as soon as God signified his mind in that particular, so we having our judgments informed about the true way of Worship, do not dare to stifle the Light God hath given us.

Now albeit there are some differences between many godly divines and us in church constitution, yet inasmuch as those things are not the essence of Christianity, but that we do agree in the fundamental doctrine thereof, there is sufficient ground to lay aside all bitterness and prejudice, and labor to maintain a spirit of love each to other, knowing we shall never see all alike here. We find in the primitive times that the baptism of Christ was not universally know. Witness the ignorance of Apollos that eminent disciple and minister, which know only the baptism of John. And if God shall enlighten any into any truth, which they shall stifle for base and unwarrantable ends, know that it is God must judge, and not man. And wherein we cannot concur, let us leave that to the coming of Christ Jesus, as they did their difficult cases in the Church of old until there did arise a priest with Urim and Thummin, that might certainly inform them of the mind of God thereabout.

I have proposed three creeds to your consideration,
which ought thoroughly to be believed and embraced by all those that would be accounted Christians, viz. the Nicene Creed, Athanasian Creed, and the Creed commonly called the Apostles.

The last of which contains the sum of the Gospel, which is industriously opened and explained. And I beseech you do not slight it because of its form, nor antiquity, nor because supposed to be composed by men; neither because some that hold it maintain some errors, or whose conversation may not be correspondent to such fundamental principles of salvation; but take this for a perpetual rule, that whatever is good in any, owned by any, whatever error or vice it may be mixed withal, the good must not be rejected for the error or vice sake, but owned,
commended, and accepted. Here is also in the close of the Book a brief, but full exposition of that prayer Christ taught His disciples. Also, the Decalogue, or Ten Commandments unfolded.

Now forasmuch as I have taken a great deal of pains in gathering these broken fragments together for your utility and profit, I hope you will take a little pains to read it, and more to live it; and I pray do it seriously and observingly. Reade it humbly and frequently, read it with prayer and meditation, then am I sure thou who art a true Christian wilt love it more & more.

And as you love your own souls, love your children’s, and declare it in praying for them, as Job did for his, and instructing them as Abraham did his, also winning them to good by a good example. And that this book may be of advantage to youth as well as others, it is catechistically handled for their easier learning the principles of Christian religion, that so they being seasoned with the true articles of Christian Faith, may not so easily be tainted with the sentiments of men of corrupt minds in time of temptation. And it is heartily desired that parents,
especially professing ones, were more concerned for the everlasting welfare of their children, as David was for Solomon, when he charged him near his death to keep the commandments and judgments of God above all. And if Parents would but conscientiously read those Divine oracles which hold forth their duty to their children, it would doubtless be to them of great advantage.

As for this that I have presented to public view, I beg the reader’s kind indulgence as to the faults escaped therein. And for those whom the Lord hath committed to my charge, that the eternal God may be your refuge, and underneath you everlasting arms; that Grace may be opened to your hearts, and your hearts to grace; that the blessing of the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob may be upon you, and the eternal Spirit may be with you, shall be the prayer of your unworthy brother, but more unworthy pastor,

H.C.
