>Psalm 19 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director. A psalm of David. 
>
><sup>1</sup> The heavens declare the glory of God, and the expanse proclaims the work of his hands. 
>
><sup>2</sup> Day after day they pour out speech; night after night they communicate knowledge. 
>
><sup>3</sup> There is no speech; there are no words; their voice is not heard. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Their message has gone out to the whole earth, and their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens he has pitched a tent for the sun. 
>
><sup>5</sup> It is like a bridegroom coming from his home; it rejoices like an athlete running a course. 
>
><sup>6</sup> It rises from one end of the heavens and circles to their other end; nothing is hidden from its heat. 
>
><sup>7</sup> The instruction of the LORD is perfect, renewing one’s life; the testimony of the LORD is trustworthy, making the inexperienced wise.

><sup>11</sup> In addition, your servant is warned by them, and in keeping them there is an abundant reward. 
>
><sup>12</sup> Who perceives his unintentional sins? Cleanse me from my hidden faults. 
>
><sup>13</sup> Moreover, keep your servant from willful sins; do not let them rule me. Then I will be blameless and cleansed from blatant rebellion. 
>
><sup>14</sup> May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable to you, LORD, my rock and my Redeemer.
