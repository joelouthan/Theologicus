## The Devotion

What is sin?

The Oxford Dictionary defines sin as "An act which is regarded as a transgression of the divine law and an offense against God; a violation (esp. wilful or deliberate) of some religious or moral principle." [^1]

God defines sin as "falling short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23).

In other words, God is most glorious--that is, *most perfect* and *maxed out perfection* in his glory. Let us not confuse actual perfection, which can only be found in God alone, with the local coffee diner that makes the "most perfect" cinnamon rolls ever. Humans, especially English speakers, have run out of superlatives akin to good/better/best to describe the good things in our world--never mind what the actual proper definition of "perfect" is in the standard of who God is.

Do you know what the effects of sin are on our world? Even the good things from God in our world are not as good as what they could be in the presence of God.

And it was never supposed to be this way. Sexual immorality, idol worship, hatred, foolishness, pride, and every other abomination was not the intention of God. God is the source of good and not evil. He can only do what is good and not sin. He did not make the world full of sickness, disease, cancer, betrayal, grief, mental illness, and death. He made the world *actually* perfect and *actually* good.

Sin entered through one man, our original father, Adam. Adam was made good, perfect, and right-standing with God. God gave Adam the ability to obey God perfectly. Not only with morality but with one commandment: don't eat from this tree. If Adam obeyed God and grew and matured in wisdom and stature, he would have not only been given an eternal, perfect, good life but for his descendants as well. 

But we know that did not happen. Adam fell into temptation. Adam did not struggle with sin. Adam sinned against God. Therefore, famine, poverty, lack, war, sadness, and anger have entered. We know this because we experience it firsthand. We are feeling the effects of people trying desperately to grab whatever power they can for their ill-gotten gains--and if some people are broken or killed along the way, it is no concern to them.

This is a sin. And because of sin, even my pithy little pitiful explanation of sin falls way, way short. Because I was born in sin, I cannot correctly define sin and give it its whole explanation. My brokenness and sinfulness prevent me from uncovering any of my potential sin-masking blind spots in my life. That is why this chapter will fall short of giving you the best definition of sin.

This sin is not just a brokenness I was born into, but it was an offense that I have committed time and time again throughout my life. And to even think I might have a good moment in time without sin:

>James 2:10 For whoever keeps the entire law, and yet stumbles at one point, is guilty of breaking it all.

>Galatians 3:10 For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, because it is written, Everyone who does not do everything written in the book of the law is cursed.

God has set the standard of righteousness, which is his law. Keeping the law does not just mean keeping it from the moment you have known about it but instead keeping it from birth. For:

>Psalm 58:3-5 The wicked go astray from the womb;  
>liars wander about from birth.  
>They have venom like the venom of a snake,  
>like the deaf cobra that stops up its ears,  
>that does not listen to the sound of the charmers  
>who skillfully weave spells.

Too many people read these passages, and they think, "Oh, that is them--that is not me." Yes, the same man who wrote this passage also wrote:

>Psalm 51:3-5 For I am conscious of my rebellion,  
>and my sin is always before me.  
>Against you — you alone — I have sinned  
>and done this evil in your sight.  
>So you are right when you pass sentence;  
>you are blameless when you judge.  
>Indeed, I was guilty when I was born;  
>I was sinful when my mother conceived me.

For the psalmist who wrote:

>Psalm 73:4-12 They have an easy time until they die,  
>and their bodies are well fed.  
>They are not in trouble like others;  
>they are not afflicted like most people.  
>Therefore, pride is their necklace,  
>and violence covers them like a garment.  
>Their eyes bulge out from fatness;  
>the imaginations of their hearts run wild.  
>They mock, and they speak maliciously;  
>they arrogantly threaten oppression.  
>They set their mouths against heaven,  
>and their tongues strut across the earth.  
>Therefore his people turn to them  
>and drink in their overflowing words.  
>The wicked say, "How can God know?  
>Does the Most High know everything?"  
>Look at them — the wicked!  
>They are always at ease,  
>and they increase their wealth.

Is the same psalmist realized just a few quick moments later:

>Psalm 73:21-22 When I became embittered  
>and my innermost being was wounded,  
>I was stupid and didn't understand;  
>I was an unthinking animal toward you.

The ESV reads, "I was brutish and ignorant; I was like a beast toward you." This is not unlike when God turned Nebuchadnezzar into a beast that "was driven away from people, ate grass like cattle, and drenched with dew from the sky until his hair grew like eagles' feathers and his nails like birds' claws." (Daniel 4:33)

What we see on the outside of King Nebuchadnezzar is a glimpse, a facet of the heart of the man within.

All because of sin.

## The Scriptures

>Genesis 3:4-7 “No! You will certainly not die,” the serpent said to the woman. “In fact, God knows that when you eat it your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” The woman saw that the tree was good for food and delightful to look at, and that it was desirable for obtaining wisdom. So she took some of its fruit and ate it; she also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.

>Genesis 3:14 So the LORD God said to the serpent:  
>Because you have done this,  
>you are cursed more than any livestock  
>and more than any wild animal.  
>You will move on your belly  
>and eat dust all the days of your life.

>Genesis 3:22-24 The LORD God said, “Since the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil, he must not reach out, take from the tree of life, eat, and live forever.” So the LORD God sent him away from the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he was taken. He drove the man out and stationed the cherubim and the flaming, whirling sword east of the garden of Eden to guard the way to the tree of life.

>Genesis 3:16–19  
><sup>16</sup> He said to the woman: I will intensify your labor pains; you will bear children with painful effort. Your desire will be for your husband, yet he will rule over you. 
>
><sup>17</sup> And he said to the man, “Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, ‘Do not eat from it’: The ground is cursed because of you. You will eat from it by means of painful labor all the days of your life. 
>
><sup>18</sup> It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field. 
>
><sup>19</sup> You will eat bread by the sweat of your brow until you return to the ground, since you were taken from it. For you are dust, and you will return to dust.”

>Romans 3:10–19  
><sup>10</sup> as it is written: There is no one righteous, not even one. 
>
><sup>11</sup> There is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God. 
>
><sup>12</sup> All have turned away; all alike have become worthless. There is no one who does what is good, not even one. 
>
><sup>13</sup> Their throat is an open grave; they deceive with their tongues. Vipers’ venom is under their lips. 
>
><sup>14</sup> Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness. 
>
><sup>15</sup> Their feet are swift to shed blood; 
>
><sup>16</sup> ruin and wretchedness are in their paths, 
>
><sup>17</sup> and the path of peace they have not known. 
>
><sup>18</sup> There is no fear of God before their eyes. 
>
><sup>19</sup> Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are subject to the law, so that every mouth may be shut and the whole world may become subject to God’s judgment.

>Romans 3:23 For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.

>Leviticus 18:24–22:31  
><sup>24</sup> “Do not defile yourselves by any of these practices, for the nations I am driving out before you have defiled themselves by all these things. 
>
><sup>25</sup> The land has become defiled, so I am punishing it for its iniquity, and the land will vomit out its inhabitants. 
>
><sup>26</sup> But you are to keep my statutes and ordinances. You must not commit any of these detestable acts—not the native or the alien who resides among you. 
>
><sup>27</sup> For the people who were in the land prior to you have committed all these detestable acts, and the land has become defiled. 
>
><sup>28</sup> If you defile the land, it will vomit you out as it has vomited out the nations that were before you. 
>
><sup>29</sup> Any person who does any of these detestable practices is to be cut off from his people. 
>
><sup>30</sup> You must keep my instruction to not do any of the detestable customs that were practiced before you, so that you do not defile yourselves by them; I am the LORD your God.” 
>
><sup>19:1</sup> The LORD spoke to Moses: 
>
><sup>2</sup> “Speak to the entire Israelite community and tell them: Be holy because I, the LORD your God, am holy. 
>
><sup>3</sup> “Each of you is to respect his mother and father. You are to keep my Sabbaths; I am the LORD your God. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Do not turn to worthless idols or make cast images of gods for yourselves; I am the LORD your God. 
>
><sup>5</sup> “When you offer a fellowship sacrifice to the LORD, sacrifice it so that you may be accepted. 
>
><sup>6</sup> It is to be eaten on the day you sacrifice it or on the next day, but what remains on the third day must be burned. 
>
><sup>7</sup> If any is eaten on the third day, it is a repulsive thing; it will not be accepted. 
>
><sup>8</sup> Anyone who eats it will bear his iniquity, for he has profaned what is holy to the LORD. That person is to be cut off from his people. 
>
><sup>9</sup> “When you reap the harvest of your land, you are not to reap to the very edge of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest. 
>
><sup>10</sup> Do not strip your vineyard bare or gather its fallen grapes. Leave them for the poor and the resident alien; I am the LORD your God.

><sup>11</sup> “Do not steal. Do not act deceptively or lie to one another. 
>
><sup>12</sup> Do not swear falsely by my name, profaning the name of your God; I am the LORD. 
>
><sup>13</sup> “Do not oppress your neighbor or rob him. The wages due a hired worker must not remain with you until morning. 
>
><sup>14</sup> Do not curse the deaf or put a stumbling block in front of the blind, but you are to fear your God; I am the LORD. 
>
><sup>15</sup> “Do not act unjustly when deciding a case. Do not be partial to the poor or give preference to the rich; judge your neighbor fairly. 
>
><sup>16</sup> Do not go about spreading slander among your people; do not jeopardize your neighbor’s life; I am the LORD. 
>
><sup>17</sup> “Do not harbor hatred against your brother. Rebuke your neighbor directly, and you will not incur guilt because of him. 
>
><sup>18</sup> Do not take revenge or bear a grudge against members of your community, but love your neighbor as yourself; I am the LORD. 
>
><sup>19</sup> “You are to keep my statutes. Do not crossbreed two different kinds of your livestock, sow your fields with two kinds of seed, or put on a garment made of two kinds of material. 
>
><sup>20</sup> “If a man has sexual intercourse with a woman who is a slave designated for another man, but she has not been redeemed or given her freedom, there must be punishment. They are not to be put to death, because she had not been freed. 
>
><sup>21</sup> However, he must bring a ram as his guilt offering to the LORD at the entrance to the tent of meeting. 
>
><sup>22</sup> The priest will make atonement on his behalf before the LORD with the ram of the guilt offering for the sin he has committed, and he will be forgiven for the sin he committed. 
>
><sup>23</sup> “When you come into the land and plant any kind of tree for food, you are to consider the fruit forbidden. It will be forbidden to you for three years; it is not to be eaten. 
>
><sup>24</sup> In the fourth year all its fruit is to be consecrated as a praise offering to the LORD. 
>
><sup>25</sup> But in the fifth year you may eat its fruit. In this way its yield will increase for you; I am the LORD your God. 
>
><sup>26</sup> “You are not to eat anything with blood in it. You are not to practice divination or witchcraft. 
>
><sup>27</sup> You are not to cut off the hair at the sides of your head or mar the edge of your beard. 
>
><sup>28</sup> You are not to make gashes on your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on yourselves; I am the LORD. 
>
><sup>29</sup> “Do not debase your daughter by making her a prostitute, or the land will be prostituted and filled with depravity. 
>
><sup>30</sup> Keep my Sabbaths and revere my sanctuary; I am the LORD. 
>
><sup>31</sup> “Do not turn to mediums or consult spiritists, or you will be defiled by them; I am the LORD your God.

>
><sup>33</sup> “When an alien resides with you in your land, you must not oppress him.

><sup>34</sup> You will regard the alien who resides with you as the native-born among you. You are to love him as yourself, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt; I am the LORD your God. 
>
><sup>35</sup> “Do not be unfair in measurements of length, weight, or volume.

>
><sup>37</sup> Keep all my statutes and all my ordinances and do them; I am the LORD.” 
>
><sup>20:1</sup> The LORD spoke to Moses: 
>
><sup>2</sup> “Say to the Israelites: Any Israelite or alien residing in Israel who gives any of his children to Molech must be put to death; the people of the country are to stone him. 
>
><sup>3</sup> I will turn against that man and cut him off from his people, because he gave his offspring to Molech, defiling my sanctuary and profaning my holy name. 
>
><sup>4</sup> But if the people of the country look the other way when that man gives any of his children to Molech, and do not put him to death, 
>
><sup>5</sup> then I will turn against that man and his family, and cut off from their people both him and all who follow him in prostituting themselves with Molech. 
>
><sup>6</sup> “Whoever turns to mediums or spiritists and prostitutes himself with them, I will turn against that person and cut him off from his people.

><sup>18</sup> If a man sleeps with a menstruating woman and has sexual intercourse with her, he has exposed the source of her flow, and she has uncovered the source of her blood. Both of them are to be cut off from their people. 
>
><sup>19</sup> You must not have sexual intercourse with your mother’s sister or your father’s sister, for it is exposing one’s own blood relative; both people will bear their iniquity. 
>
><sup>20</sup> If a man sleeps with his aunt, he has violated the intimacy that belongs to his uncle; they will bear their guilt and die childless. 
>
><sup>21</sup> If a man marries his brother’s wife, it is impurity. He has violated the intimacy that belongs to his brother; they will be childless.

><sup>31</sup> “You are to keep my commands and do them; I am the LORD.

>Psalm 51  
><sup></sup> For the choir director. A psalm of David, when the prophet Nathan came to him after he had gone to Bathsheba.

><sup>1</sup> Be gracious to me, God, according to your faithful love; according to your abundant compassion, blot out my rebellion.

><sup>2</sup> Completely wash away my guilt and cleanse me from my sin.

><sup>3</sup> For I am conscious of my rebellion, and my sin is always before me. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Against you—you alone—I have sinned and done this evil in your sight. So you are right when you pass sentence; you are blameless when you judge.

><sup>6</sup> Surely you desire integrity in the inner self, and you teach me wisdom deep within.
