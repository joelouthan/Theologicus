## The Devotion

What has the Scriptures firmly established? You and I cannot and do not seek after God, go to God, turn to God, repent of sins to God, face God and choose God in our natural state.

>Ephesians 2:1 And you were dead in your trespasses and sins

**Dead people do not choose. Dead people are dead. They stay dead.**

We have been dead in our trespasses and sins. Then how do we choose to be rescued since we are dead. You might say, "I am taking the death too liternal." Oh, and yet, if someone outside of us does nothing to intervene, then we will perish! We will die in our trespasses and sins and burn in the eternal torment of hell under the just wrath of the Christ Almighty because we are his enemies.

For us not to perish in our sins, we must be rescued!

>Romans 7:24 What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? 

Who is going to do it? 

Who can rescue us?

Your pastor? He is as sinful as you are. He too was born in inquity and born as a son of Adam.

Your latest idol? They are not even gods and God is far above all puny gods.

Your good works? But our good works are infected, stained, and spoiled by our born sin. Our "good" works are messed up and jacked up beyond redemption.

>Isaiah 64:6 All of us have become like something unclean, and all our righteous acts are like a polluted garment; all of us wither like a leaf, and our iniquities carry us away like the wind.

Who can rescue us and set us free from this bondage of death? **Christ Jesus is his name!**

>Romans 7:25 Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with my mind I myself am serving the law of God, but with my flesh, the law of sin.

And since Christ, the only begotten Son of God, holy, righteous, and perfect in obedience for us, his rescue alone comes with only bonafide guarantee:

>John 3:14–17 “Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. For God loved the world in this way: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.

>Romans 8:1 Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus,

>1 Timothy 1:15 This saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance: “Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners”—and I am the worst of them.

>Romans 8:18–21 For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is going to be revealed to us. For the creation eagerly waits with anticipation for God’s sons to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to futility—not willingly, but because of him who subjected it—in the hope that the creation itself will also be set free from the bondage to decay into the glorious freedom of God’s children.

We have been rescued by Christ on high! And since God is free, we are free indeed. Since we are co-heirs with the Son who has inherited everything, we get everything, including, the glory of the freedom of the children of God.

My brothers and sisters, you have been free from the bondage of sin. Now, go and love God! Now, go and love others. You are free to do so. Go and worship him freely in the name of Jesus. Amen!

## The Scriptures

### Saved from sin

>Matthew 1:21 She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”

>Romans 6  
><sup>1</sup> What should we say then? Should we continue in sin so that grace may multiply? 
>
><sup>2</sup> Absolutely not! How can we who died to sin still live in it? 
>
><sup>3</sup> Or are you unaware that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 
>
><sup>4</sup> Therefore we were buried with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too may walk in newness of life. 
>
><sup>5</sup> For if we have been united with him in the likeness of his death, we will certainly also be in the likeness of his resurrection. 
>
><sup>6</sup> For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be rendered powerless so that we may no longer be enslaved to sin, 
>
><sup>7</sup> since a person who has died is freed from sin. 
>
><sup>8</sup> Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him, 
>
><sup>9</sup> because we know that Christ, having been raised from the dead, will not die again. Death no longer rules over him. 
>
><sup>10</sup> For the death he died, he died to sin once for all time; but the life he lives, he lives to God. 
>
><sup>11</sup> So, you too consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus. 
>
><sup>12</sup> Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, so that you obey its desires. 
>
><sup>13</sup> And do not offer any parts of it to sin as weapons for unrighteousness. But as those who are alive from the dead, offer yourselves to God, and all the parts of yourselves to God as weapons for righteousness. 
>
><sup>14</sup> For sin will not rule over you, because you are not under the law but under grace. 
>
><sup>15</sup> What then? Should we sin because we are not under the law but under grace? Absolutely not! 
>
><sup>16</sup> Don’t you know that if you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of that one you obey—either of sin leading to death or of obedience leading to righteousness? 
>
><sup>17</sup> But thank God that, although you used to be slaves of sin, you obeyed from the heart that pattern of teaching to which you were handed over, 
>
><sup>18</sup> and having been set free from sin, you became enslaved to righteousness. 
>
><sup>19</sup> I am using a human analogy because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you offered the parts of yourselves as slaves to impurity, and to greater and greater lawlessness, so now offer them as slaves to righteousness, which results in sanctification. 
>
><sup>20</sup> For when you were slaves of sin, you were free with regard to righteousness. 
>
><sup>21</sup> So what fruit was produced then from the things you are now ashamed of? The outcome of those things is death. 
>
><sup>22</sup> But now, since you have been set free from sin and have become enslaved to God, you have your fruit, which results in sanctification—and the outcome is eternal life! 
>
><sup>23</sup> For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

### Saved from Satan and demons

>Colossians 2:15 He disarmed the rulers and authorities and disgraced them publicly; he triumphed over them in him.

### Saved from hell

>2 Peter 2:4–11 For if God didn’t spare the angels who sinned but cast them into hell and delivered them in chains of utter darkness to be kept for judgment; and if he didn’t spare the ancient world, but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others, when he brought the flood on the world of the ungodly; and if he reduced the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes and condemned them to extinction, making them an example of what is coming to the ungodly; and if he rescued righteous Lot, distressed by the depraved behavior of the immoral (for as that righteous man lived among them day by day, his righteous soul was tormented by the lawless deeds he saw and heard)—<span class="bgyc">then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment, especially those who follow the polluting desires of the flesh and despise authority</span>. Bold, arrogant people! They are not afraid to slander the glorious ones; however, angels, who are greater in might and power, do not bring a slanderous charge against them before the Lord.

### Saved from death

>Romans 8:12–13 So then, brothers and sisters, we are not obligated to the flesh to live according to the flesh, because if you live according to the flesh, you are going to die. But if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.

### Saved apart from the world

>John 15:18-20 “If the world hates you, understand that it hated me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own. <span class="bgyc">However, because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of it, the world hates you.</span> Remember the word I spoke to you: ‘A servant is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours.

### Saved from God

>Matthew 10:28 Don’t fear those who kill the body but are not able to kill the soul; rather, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.

>Luke 12:5 But I will show you the one to fear: Fear him who has authority to throw people into hell after death. Yes, I say to you, this is the one to fear!

>Hosea 2:2–13  
><sup>2</sup> Rebuke your mother; rebuke her. For she is not my wife and I am not her husband. Let her remove the promiscuous look from her face and her adultery from between her breasts. 
>
><sup>3</sup> Otherwise, I will strip her naked and expose her as she was on the day of her birth. I will make her like a desert and like a parched land, and I will let her die of thirst. 
>
><sup>4</sup> I will have no compassion on her children because they are the children of promiscuity. 
>
><sup>5</sup> Yes, their mother is promiscuous; she conceived them and acted shamefully. For she thought, “I will follow my lovers, the men who give me my food and water, my wool and flax, my oil and drink.” 
>
><sup>6</sup> Therefore, this is what I will do: I will block her way with thorns; I will enclose her with a wall, so that she cannot find her paths. 
>
><sup>7</sup> She will pursue her lovers but not catch them; she will look for them but not find them. Then she will think, “I will go back to my former husband, for then it was better for me than now.” 
>
><sup>8</sup> She does not recognize that it is I who gave her the grain, the new wine, and the fresh oil. I lavished silver and gold on her, which they used for Baal. 
>
><sup>9</sup> Therefore, I will take back my grain in its time and my new wine in its season; I will take away my wool and linen, which were to cover her nakedness. 
>
><sup>10</sup> Now I will expose her shame in the sight of her lovers, and no one will rescue her from my power. 
>
><sup>11</sup> I will put an end to all her celebrations: her feasts, New Moons, and Sabbaths— all her festivals. 
>
><sup>12</sup> I will devastate her vines and fig trees. She thinks that these are her wages that her lovers have given her. I will turn them into a thicket, and the wild animals will eat them. 
>
><sup>13</sup> And I will punish her for the days of the Baals, to which she burned incense. She put on her rings and her jewelry and followed her lovers, but she forgot me. This is the LORD’s declaration.

### Saved by God 

>Hosea 2:14–15  
><sup>14</sup> Therefore, I am going to persuade her, lead her to the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her. 
>
><sup>15</sup> There I will give her vineyards back to her and make the Valley of Achor into a gateway of hope. There she will respond as she did in the days of her youth, as in the day she came out of the land of Egypt.

### Saved to God
