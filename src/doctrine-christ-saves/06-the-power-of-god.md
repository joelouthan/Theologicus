## The Text

>Romans 6:6–11 For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be rendered powerless so that we may no longer be enslaved to sin, since a person who has died is freed from sin. Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him, because **we know that Christ, having been raised from the dead, will not die again. Death no longer rules over him. For the death he died, he died to sin once for all time; but the life he lives, he lives to God. So, you too consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.**

## The Devotion

This is the power of God in salvation--the gospel of Jesus Christ. He has called us to eternal life. But how can this be since we are sinners--dead in our trespasses and sins. (Ephesians 2:1) How can dead men look upon the risen Christ and be saved into eternal life? (John 3:14-15) How can the dead look into their dead, sinful hearts and twisted minds and choose to follow the Christ?

>John 11:32–37 As soon as Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and told him, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother wouldn’t have died!” When Jesus saw her crying, and the Jews who had come with her crying, he was deeply moved in his spirit and troubled. “Where have you put him?” he asked. “Lord,” they told him, “come and see.” Jesus wept. So the Jews said, “See how he loved him!” But some of them said, “Couldn’t he who opened the blind man’s eyes also have kept this man from dying?”*  

This is our Christ putting on the fullest display of what happens to dead sinners when they are dead in their trespasses and sins and cannot make themselves alive again. They cannot tilt their dead heads and look up with their dead eyes and see the risen Christ. No! They cannot stir up within themselves with their dead hearts and wicked desires, turn and follow Jesus.

He has stepped from the infinite into the finite, heaven into earth, from glory into humility--condescending to our level, taking on flesh. He has come to give us his Spirit and the Father's heart. He has come to renew our minds, open our eyes, turn on our ears, awaken our mouths, and give us life!

He has come to set the captives free!

He has come to heal the sick!

He has come to raise the dead!

Jesus came into this world to save sinners!

> John 11:38–39 Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying against it. “Remove the stone,” Jesus said. Martha, the dead man’s sister, told him, “Lord, there is already a stench because he has been dead four days.”  

W were born sinners as the children of God. Four days? Try since Genesis 3. Our original parents sinned against the holy God and they were cast out. But look at this wonderful calling: "I will put hostility between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring. He will strike your head, and you will strike his heel." (Genesis 3:15) Before God cursed Adam and Eve and the earth, he called to them to believe in the Almighty God. And the curse of sin and death of Adam doesn't even belong to Adam! How do I know? Before they were exiled from the garden, Adam and Eve believed the gospel that was called to bring them from death to life.

> Genesis 3:21 The Lord God made clothing from skins for the man and his wife, and he clothed them.  

This is the gospel, and stop me when you heard this before: God would offer the sacrifice of his only begotten Son. Because of the perfect obedience and the death of his Son, he clothes us with the righteousness of his Son.

God promised the snake crusher and the death destroyer. Let us see if he delivers.

> John 11:40–42 Jesus said to her, “Didn’t I tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?” So they removed the stone. Then Jesus raised his eyes and said, “Father, I thank you that you heard me. I know that you always hear me, but because of the crowd standing here I said this, so that they may believe you sent me.”  

Jesus, God who took on flesh, dwelled with us, condescended to us, and became us, and walked this earth in perfect obedience to the law of God, was always in right-standing and perfect love and affection with his wonderful Father. And the Christ, being the only begotten Son, was not going to do anything he had not seen his own Father do, turns his eyes upon the Almighty God and gives thanks for what God is about to do.

The Christ--as human as you and me. Experiences the dreaded, scorching heat of the day. Fights off the sickness-inducing waves of the sea when he goes commercial fishing with his buds. Hungered. Thirst. Sleepy. Tired. Lonely. Homeless. Sad. Angry. Frustrated. Tender. Gentle. Grieved.

And all his Godliness and his humanity stood right in front of death. Chances are, if you stare down Death, Death is going to win. Yet, in this instance, Death is staring down the Son of Man. "What would Christ dare to do?" Death thinks as he perches over his most recent trophy--Christ's best friend's dead, rotting corpse. What does the Christ think he is going to do now?

Christ, whose face still hot from weeping, turns his eyes down from the heavens and stares straight through Death. For to defeat Death here, Christ is so Almighty that he doesn't even have to acknowledge Death. He calls with a thunderous voice...

> "LAZARUS, COME FORTH!"  

What do you think happens when you are born again? What do you think happened when you arose from death into life? What do you think happened when you first believe?

You were called by the Almighty Triune God himself.

CHILD OF GOD, BELOVED ONE OF GOD, COME FORTH!

For all the advances and the mere power that mankind welds, they have no power to stop death. Yet, our Christ, fully God and fully man, calls forth sinners from the dead and makes them alive to God forever and ever.

This is the power of God in salvation--the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.

>Genesis 6:11–22 Now the earth was corrupt in God’s sight, and the earth was filled with wickedness. God saw how corrupt the earth was, for every creature had corrupted its way on the earth. Then God said to Noah, “I have decided to put an end to every creature, for the earth is filled with wickedness because of them; therefore I am going to destroy them along with the earth. “Make yourself an ark of gopher wood. Make rooms in the ark, and cover it with pitch inside and outside. This is how you are to make it: The ark will be 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high. You are to make a roof, finishing the sides of the ark to within eighteen inches of the roof. You are to put a door in the side of the ark. Make it with lower, middle, and upper decks. “Understand that I am bringing a flood—floodwaters on the earth to destroy every creature under heaven with the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish. But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark with your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives. You are also to bring into the ark two of all the living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you. Two of everything—from the birds according to their kinds, from the livestock according to their kinds, and from the animals that crawl on the ground according to their kinds—will come to you so that you can keep them alive. Take with you every kind of food that is eaten; gather it as food for you and for them.” And Noah did this. He did everything that God had commanded him.

>Genesis 12:1–9 The LORD said to Abram: Go from your land, your relatives, and your father’s house to the land that I will show you. I will make you into a great nation, I will bless you, I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, I will curse anyone who treats you with contempt, and all the peoples on earth will be blessed through you. So Abram went, as the LORD had told him, and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he left Haran. He took his wife, Sarai, his nephew Lot, all the possessions they had accumulated, and the people they had acquired in Haran, and they set out for the land of Canaan. When they came to the land of Canaan, Abram passed through the land to the site of Shechem, at the oak of Moreh. (At that time the Canaanites were in the land.) The LORD appeared to Abram and said, “To your offspring, I will give this land.” So he built an altar there to the LORD who had appeared to him. From there he moved on to the hill country east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. He built an altar to the LORD there, and he called on the name of the LORD. Then Abram journeyed by stages to the Negev.

>Genesis 17:19 But God said, “No. Your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will name him Isaac. I will confirm my covenant with him as a permanent covenant for his future offspring.

>Genesis 37:3–11 Now Israel loved Joseph more than his other sons because Joseph was a son born to him in his old age, and he made a long-sleeved robe for him. When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not bring themselves to speak peaceably to him. Then Joseph had a dream. When he told it to his brothers, they hated him even more. He said to them, “Listen to this dream I had: There we were, binding sheaves of grain in the field. Suddenly my sheaf stood up, and your sheaves gathered around it and bowed down to my sheaf.” “Are you really going to reign over us?” his brothers asked him. “Are you really going to rule us?” So they hated him even more because of his dream and what he had said. Then he had another dream and told it to his brothers. “Look,” he said, “I had another dream, and this time the sun, moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.” He told his father and brothers, and his father rebuked him. “What kind of dream is this that you have had?” he said. “Am I and your mother and your brothers really going to come and bow down to the ground before you?” His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind.

>Joshua 22:22 “The Mighty One, God, the LORD! The Mighty One, God, the LORD! He knows, and may Israel also know. Do not spare us today, if it was in rebellion or treachery against the LORD

>Judges 6:11–12 The angel of the LORD came, and he sat under the oak that was in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash, the Abiezrite. His son Gideon was threshing wheat in the winepress in order to hide it from the Midianites. Then the angel of the LORD appeared to him and said, “The LORD is with you, valiant warrior.”

>Judges 13:1–7 The Israelites again did what was evil in the LORD’s sight, so the LORD handed them over to the Philistines forty years. There was a certain man from Zorah, from the family of Dan, whose name was Manoah; his wife was unable to conceive and had no children. The angel of the LORD appeared to the woman and said to her, “Although you are unable to conceive and have no children, you will conceive and give birth to a son. Now please be careful not to drink wine or beer, or to eat anything unclean; for indeed, you will conceive and give birth to a son. You must never cut his hair, because the boy will be a Nazirite to God from birth, and he will begin to save Israel from the power of the Philistines.” Then the woman went and told her husband, “A man of God came to me. He looked like the awe-inspiring angel of God. I didn’t ask him where he came from, and he didn’t tell me his name. He said to me, ‘You will conceive and give birth to a son. Therefore, do not drink wine or beer, and do not eat anything unclean, because the boy will be a Nazirite to God from birth until the day of his death.’ ”

>1 Samuel 16:11–13 Samuel asked him, “Are these all the sons you have?” “There is still the youngest,” he answered, “but right now he’s tending the sheep.” Samuel told Jesse, “Send for him. We won’t sit down to eat until he gets here.” So Jesse sent for him. He had beautiful eyes and a healthy, handsome appearance. Then the LORD said, “Anoint him, for he is the one.” So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and the Spirit of the LORD came powerfully on David from that day forward. Then Samuel set out and went to Ramah.

>2 Samuel 1:19 The splendor of Israel lies slain on your heights. How the mighty have fallen! 

>2 Samuel 1:21 Mountains of Gilboa, let no dew or rain be on you, or fields of offerings, for there the shield of the mighty was defiled— the shield of Saul, no longer anointed with oil.

>1 Kings 19:11 Then he said, “Go out and stand on the mountain in the LORD’s presence.” At that moment, the LORD passed by. A great and mighty wind was tearing at the mountains and was shattering cliffs before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake.

>1 Kings 19:19–21 Elijah left there and found Elisha son of Shaphat as he was plowing. Twelve teams of oxen were in front of him, and he was with the twelfth team. Elijah walked by him and threw his mantle over him. Elisha left the oxen, ran to follow Elijah, and said, “Please let me kiss my father and mother, and then I will follow you.” “Go on back,” he replied, “for what have I done to you?” So he turned back from following him, took the team of oxen, and slaughtered them. With the oxen’s wooden yoke and plow, he cooked the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he left, followed Elijah, and served him.

>Nehemiah 9:32 So now, our God—the great, mighty, and awe-inspiring God who keeps his gracious covenant— do not view lightly all the hardships that have afflicted us, our kings and leaders, our priests and prophets, our ancestors and all your people, from the days of the Assyrian kings until today.

And one called to another: Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of Armies; his glory fills the whole earth. The foundations of the doorways shook at the sound of their voices, and the temple was filled with smoke. Then I said: Woe is me for I am ruined because I am a man of unclean lips and live among a people of unclean lips, and because my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of Armies. Then one of the seraphim flew to me, and in his hand was a glowing coal that he had taken from the altar with tongs. He touched my mouth with it and said: Now that this has touched your lips, your iniquity is removed and your sin is atoned for. Then I heard the voice of the Lord asking: Who will I send? Who will go for us? I said: Here I am. Send me.

Then he said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” I replied, “Lord GOD, only you know.” He said to me, “Prophesy concerning these bones and say to them: Dry bones, hear the word of the LORD! This is what the Lord GOD says to these bones: I will cause breath to enter you, and you will live. I will put tendons on you, make flesh grow on you, and cover you with skin.

He will be filled with the Holy Spirit while still in his mother’s womb. He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God. And he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of fathers to their children, and the disobedient to the understanding of the righteous, to make ready for the Lord a prepared people.”

He has seen the Father. “Truly I tell you, anyone who believes has eternal life.

>John 11:25–27 Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me, even if he dies, will live. Everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?” “Yes, Lord,” she told him, “I believe you are the Messiah, the Son of God, who comes into the world.”

>John 11:38–44 Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying against it. “Remove the stone,” Jesus said. Martha, the dead man’s sister, told him, “Lord, there is already a stench because he has been dead four days.” Jesus said to her, “Didn’t I tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?” So they removed the stone.
