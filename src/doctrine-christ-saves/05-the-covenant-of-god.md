## The Text

>Ephesians 1:3–14 (CSB)  
><sup>3</sup> Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavens in Christ. 
>
><sup>4</sup> For he chose us in him, before the foundation of the world, to be holy and blameless in love before him. 
>
><sup>5</sup> He predestined us to be adopted as sons through Jesus Christ for himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, 
>
><sup>6</sup> to the praise of his glorious grace that he lavished on us in the Beloved One. 
>
><sup>7</sup> In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace 
>
><sup>8</sup> that he richly poured out on us with all wisdom and understanding. 
>
><sup>9</sup> He made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure that he purposed in Christ 
>
><sup>10</sup> as a plan for the right time—to bring everything together in Christ, both things in heaven and things on earth in him. 
>
><sup>11</sup> In him we have also received an inheritance, because we were predestined according to the plan of the one who works out everything in agreement with the purpose of his will, 
>
><sup>12</sup> so that we who had already put our hope in Christ might bring praise to his glory. 
>
><sup>13</sup> In him you also were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and when you believed. 
>
><sup>14</sup> The Holy Spirit is the down payment of our inheritance, until the redemption of the possession, to the praise of his glory.
