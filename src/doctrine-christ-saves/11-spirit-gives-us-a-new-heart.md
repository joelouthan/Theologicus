## The Devotion

When God saved us from eternity past, His saving work was not finished when Christ lived, died, was buried, and rose again, as though there is nothing for him for his people.

You see, every single person born of man since Adam and Eve were born inherently not in connection with God but being apart from God both infinitely and eternally. That separation is because we have no spirit of God, because our hearts were not born of God.

Sin has devastating, tearing, ripping-in-half effects. Adam and Eve felt that to a large degree, but I don’t think they could possibly fathom what it would be like for their children and their children’s children and for all of the world.

But we see the state of the world today and exponentially more than our forefathers because we have every kind of information at our fingertips.

School shootings, mass genocide, abortions in the thousands per day: there seems to be no end in depravity. And just when we think that our way of life on its own is a little better, we find out that our way of life and privilege are most often at the expense of someone else’s well-being. You just have to open your eyes and see.

And even seeing it all has gotten to be too much for most of us. Too much sin, death, disease, depravity, and tragedy for us to handle on top of our own lives.

That is the inheritance of Adam. That is what we are cursed with.

But can we for sure say "all humans” are born this way? Surely there are some who are born good? There has got to be some hope?

Back in the Old Testament, from the time of Adam, the wickedness of humankind spread throughout the earth.

>Genesis 6:5-7 When the LORD saw that human wickedness was widespread on the earth and that every inclination of the human mind was nothing but evil all the time, 6 the LORD regretted that he had made man on the earth, and he was deeply grieved. 7 Then the LORD said, “I will wipe mankind, whom I created, off the face of the earth, together with the animals, creatures that crawl, and birds of the sky—for I regret that I made them.”

When God spoke of Man, what did he declare? They were greatly wicked, and the thoughts of their hearts were only producing evil. And God regretted ever creating mankind, the very image-bearers of Himself.

Before we continue, was Noah a man? So would he have been evil or born good apart from these wicked people?

>Genesis 6:8 Noah, however, found favor with the LORD.

Does the Bible say, "But Noah was a good dude, so God decided to spare him.” No, Noah was wicked just like everyone else. But the favor and grace came upon Noah for no other reason than that God is good.

You might say, "But what about the next verse?” Let’s read that:

>Genesis 6:9 These are the family records of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among his contemporaries; Noah walked with God.

Now put verses 5 through 9 all together. Look at the order in relation to Noah. Noah was wicked. Noah’s heart continually produced evil thoughts. God regretted ever creating Noah. But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.

Because God gave him grace, it was then and only then that Noah was declared righteous and blameless in his generation. We know it’s not that Noah was born righteous or even living a righteous life apart from God because Paul quotes a psalm of David in Romans 3:

>Romans 3:9–31  

><sup> 9 </sup> What then? Are we any better off? Not at all! For we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin, 

><sup> 10 </sup> as it is written: There is no one righteous, not even one. 

><sup> 11 </sup> There is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God. 

><sup> 12 </sup> All have turned away; all alike have become worthless. There is no one who does what is good, not even one. 

><sup> 13 </sup> Their throat is an open grave; they deceive with their tongues. Vipers’ venom is under their lips. 

><sup> 14 </sup> Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness. 

><sup> 15 </sup> Their feet are swift to shed blood; 

><sup> 16 </sup> ruin and wretchedness are in their paths, 

><sup> 17 </sup> and the path of peace they have not known. 

><sup> 18 </sup> There is no fear of God before their eyes. 

><sup> 19 </sup> Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are subject to the law, so that every mouth may be shut and the whole world may become subject to God’s judgment. 

><sup> 20 </sup> For no one will be justified in his sight by the works of the law, because the knowledge of sin comes through the law. 

><sup> 21 </sup> But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed, attested by the Law and the Prophets. 

><sup> 22 </sup> The righteousness of God is through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe, since there is no distinction. 

><sup> 23 </sup> For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God; 

><sup> 24 </sup> they are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. 

><sup> 25 </sup> God presented him as the mercy seat by his blood, through faith, to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his restraint God passed over the sins previously committed. 

><sup> 26 </sup> God presented him to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so that he would be just and justify the one who has faith in Jesus. 

><sup> 27 </sup> Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By one of your works? No, on the contrary, by a law of faith. 

><sup> 28 </sup> For we conclude that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law. 

><sup> 29 </sup> Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too, 

><sup> 30 </sup> since there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith. 

><sup> 31 </sup> Do we then nullify the law through faith? Absolutely not! On the contrary, we uphold the law.

But then some would argue that God gave us laws so we could be holy. But that is not the purpose of the law. The law of God was simply put in place to get you to see all of your sin and wickedness in the presence of a holy and just God. Paul goes on to declare that the law was weak. In other words, the law of God is a mirror for your soul and heart, but that’s all it can do. The law of God was powerless and feeble to save your soul.

You know what the real kicker is: with our hearts far from him, we are not actually obeying the laws of God. I know because it is impossible for us to obey God’s law if our hearts are far from him.

>Romans 8:7-8 The mindset of the flesh is hostile to God because it does not submit to God’s law. Indeed, it is unable to do so. 8 Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.

>Isaiah 64:6 All of us have become like something unclean,

and all our righteous acts are like a polluted garment;

all of us wither like a leaf,

and our iniquities carry us away like the wind.

Because of our wicked hearts, whatever "righteous” deeds we think we are doing are just dirty rags thrown before the feet of God, thinking that will be good enough to be saved by Him.

Look at what Jesus says:

>Matthew 7:21-23 “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven. On that day, many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, didn’t we prophesy in your name, drive out demons in your name, and do many miracles in your name?’ Then I will announce to them, ‘I never knew you. Depart from me, you lawbreakers!’

Wait a minute here. These people were doing what Christ told us to do: prophesy, cast out demons, and do mighty works in his name. Christ would go on to say for us not to rejoice because we can do mighty works and the spirits are subject to us, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.

Don’t you see? We cannot know nor love God without taking this wicked heart out and replacing it with a heart from God. Nothing good comes out of a heart that was born into sin and has been sinning continuously.

Some theologians teach that the faith to believe in God comes from a tiny deposit of good given to all human beings. Well, I would accept that explanation a hundred times over than we are all basically good and can believe and trust in God out of our own strength. Because the latter is simply not happening. Whatever you may think, that faith produces a new heart, or it’s a new heart that produces faith, something absolutely good has to start the process of faith because faith (inherently good) does not come from a wicked and depraved heart. The Bible makes that clear.

Choosing God is not like what you choose for breakfast, whom you have chosen to marry, or whom you voted for in the last election. For you to believe, trust, love, and choose God, something supernatural has to occur, and this is by the work of the Spirit alone, by giving us a brand new heart from the Father, all made possible by the life, death, and resurrection of Christ alone.  It is only then that we can look upon Him with clear eyes, hear him with functioning ears, even taste him with new taste buds to know that he is good or even smell the aroma of Christ on each of us who are made fully alive by God.

When we have a new heart and His Spirit within us, we can then be fully and truthfully obedient to God. First, Christ fulfilled the law for each of us who believes and trusts in him. Now, it’s not that we have to obey the laws of God; it is that we get to obey Him.

Don’t believe obedience requires a new heart? See what God says about it.

>Ezekiel 36:24-28 “‘For I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries, and will bring you into your own land. I will also sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your impurities and all your idols. I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will remove your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. I will place my Spirit within you and cause you to follow my statutes and carefully observe my ordinances. You will live in the land that I gave your ancestors; you will be my people, and I will be your God.

It is only then that God removes us from death and despair; takes the blood of Christ and washes us clean from all unrighteousness; gives us a brand new, softened heart and a new spirit that causes us to walk in His statutes and be careful to obey His rules.

Because of what He has done, we now get to dwell in the house of the Lord forever because we are His people and He is our God!

## The Scriptures

>John 3:1–17  
><sup>1</sup> There was a man from the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. 
>
><sup>2</sup> This man came to him at night and said, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God, for no one could perform these signs you do unless God were with him.” 
>
><sup>3</sup> Jesus replied, “Truly I tell you, unless someone is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.” 
>
><sup>4</sup> “How can anyone be born when he is old?” Nicodemus asked him. “Can he enter his mother’s womb a second time and be born?” 
>
><sup>5</sup> Jesus answered, “Truly I tell you, unless someone is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. 
>
><sup>6</sup> Whatever is born of the flesh is flesh, and whatever is born of the Spirit is spirit. 
>
><sup>7</sup> Do not be amazed that I told you that you must be born again. 
>
><sup>8</sup> The wind blows where it pleases, and you hear its sound, but you don’t know where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.” 
>
><sup>9</sup> “How can these things be?” asked Nicodemus. 
>
><sup>10</sup> “Are you a teacher of Israel and don’t know these things?” Jesus replied. 
>
><sup>11</sup> “Truly I tell you, we speak what we know and we testify to what we have seen, but you do not accept our testimony. 
>
><sup>12</sup> If I have told you about earthly things and you don’t believe, how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things? 
>
><sup>13</sup> No one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven—the Son of Man. 
>
><sup>14</sup> “Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, 
>
><sup>15</sup> so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. 
>
><sup>16</sup> For God loved the world in this way: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. 
>
><sup>17</sup> For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.

>Genesis 6:5–6 When the LORD saw that human wickedness was widespread on the earth and that every inclination of the human mind was nothing but evil all the time, the LORD regretted that he had made man on the earth, and he was deeply grieved.

>Lamentations 5:3 We have become orphans, fatherless; our mothers are widows.

>1 Chronicles 29:15 For we are aliens and temporary residents in your presence as were all our ancestors. Our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope.

>Deuteronomy 10:17–22 For the LORD your God is the God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, mighty, and awe-inspiring God, showing no partiality and taking no bribe. He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the resident alien, giving him food and clothing. You are also to love the resident alien, since you were resident aliens in the land of Egypt. You are to fear the LORD your God and worship him. Remain faithful to him and take oaths in his name. He is your praise and he is your God, who has done for you these great and awe-inspiring works your eyes have seen. Your ancestors went down to Egypt, seventy people in all, and now the LORD your God has made you numerous, like the stars of the sky.

>Exodus 22:20–24 “Whoever sacrifices to any gods, except the LORD alone, is to be set apart for destruction. “You must not exploit a resident alien or oppress him, since you were resident aliens in the land of Egypt. “You must not mistreat any widow or fatherless child. If you do mistreat them, they will no doubt cry to me, and I will certainly hear their cry. My anger will burn, and I will kill you with the sword; then your wives will be widows and your children fatherless.

>Leviticus 19:33–34 “When an alien resides with you in your land, you must not oppress him. You will regard the alien who resides with you as the native-born among you. You are to love him as yourself, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt; I am the LORD your God.

>Deuteronomy 14:29 Then the Levite, who has no portion or inheritance among you, the resident alien, the fatherless, and the widow within your city gates may come, eat, and be satisfied. And the LORD your God will bless you in all the work of your hands that you do.

>Ezekiel 11:16–20 “Therefore say, ‘This is what the Lord GOD says: Though I sent them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries, yet for a little while I have been a sanctuary for them in the countries where they have gone.’ “Therefore say, ‘This is what the Lord GOD says: I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.’ “When they arrive there, they will remove all its abhorrent acts and detestable practices from it. I will give them integrity of heart and put a new spirit within them; I will remove their heart of stone from their bodies and give them a heart of flesh, so that they will follow my statutes, keep my ordinances, and practice them. They will be my people, and I will be their God.

>Deuteronomy 30:6 The LORD your God will circumcise your heart and the hearts of your descendants, and you will love him with all your heart and all your soul so that you will live.

>Deuteronomy 30:11–20 “This command that I give you today is certainly not too difficult or beyond your reach. It is not in heaven so that you have to ask, ‘Who will go up to heaven, get it for us, and proclaim it to us so that we may follow it?’ And it is not across the sea so that you have to ask, ‘Who will cross the sea, get it for us, and proclaim it to us so that we may follow it?’ But the message is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, so that you may follow it. See, today I have set before you life and prosperity, death and adversity. For I am commanding you today to love the LORD your God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commands, statutes, and ordinances, so that you may live and multiply, and the LORD your God may bless you in the land you are entering to possess. But if your heart turns away and you do not listen and you are led astray to bow in worship to other gods and serve them, I tell you today that you will certainly perish and will not prolong your days in the land you are entering to possess across the Jordan. I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse. Choose life so that you and your descendants may live, love the LORD your God, obey him, and remain faithful to him. For he is your life, and he will prolong your days as you live in the land the LORD swore to give to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”

>Nehemiah 2:12 I got up at night and took a few men with me. I didn’t tell anyone what my God had laid on my heart to do for Jerusalem. The only animal I took was the one I was riding.

>Psalm 19:14 May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable to you, LORD, my rock and my Redeemer.

>Psalm 20:4 May he give you what your heart desires and fulfill your whole purpose.

>Psalm 21:2 You have given him his heart’s desire and have not denied the request of his lips. Selah

>Psalm 27:8 My heart says this about you: “Seek his face.” LORD, I will seek your face.

>Psalm 51:10 God, create a clean heart for me and renew a steadfast spirit within me.

>Psalm 73:25–26 Who do I have in heaven but you? And I desire nothing on earth but you. My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart, my portion forever.

>Psalm 84:2 I long and yearn for the courts of the LORD; my heart and flesh cry out for the living God.

>Psalm 86:11–12 Teach me your way, LORD, and I will live by your truth. Give me an undivided mind to fear your name. I will praise you with all my heart, Lord my God, and will honor your name forever.

>Acts 2:36–38 “Therefore let all the house of Israel know with certainty that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah.” When they heard this, they were pierced to the heart and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what should we do?” Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, each of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

>Acts 4:32 Now the entire group of those who believed were of one heart and mind, and no one claimed that any of his possessions was his own, but instead they held everything in common.

>Galatians 4:6 And because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba, Father!”

>Ephesians 3:14–19 For this reason I kneel before the Father from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named. I pray that he may grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power in your inner being through his Spirit, and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. I pray that you, being rooted and firmly established in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the length and width, height and depth of God’s love, and to know Christ’s love that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.

>1 Peter 2:11 Dear friends, I urge you as strangers and exiles to abstain from sinful desires that wage war against the soul.

>James 1:27 Pure and undefiled religion before God the Father is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself unstained from the world.

>James 2:14–26 What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but does not have works? Can such faith save him? If a brother or sister is without clothes and lacks daily food and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, stay warm, and be well fed,” but you don’t give them what the body needs, what good is it? In the same way faith, if it does not have works, is dead by itself. But someone will say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without works, and I will show you faith by my works. You believe that God is one. Good! Even the demons believe—and they shudder. Senseless person! Are you willing to learn that faith without works is useless? Wasn’t Abraham our father justified by works in offering Isaac his son on the altar? You see that faith was active together with his works, and by works, faith was made complete, and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness, and he was called God’s friend. You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. In the same way, wasn’t Rahab the prostitute also justified by works in receiving the messengers and sending them out by a different route? For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.

>Ephesians 2:8–10 For you are saved by grace through faith, and this is not from yourselves; it is God’s gift—not from works, so that no one can boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared ahead of time for us to do.

>Matthew 11:29 Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, because I am lowly and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.

>Matthew 5:8 Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.

>2 Thessalonians 3:5 May the Lord direct your hearts to God’s love and Christ’s endurance.
