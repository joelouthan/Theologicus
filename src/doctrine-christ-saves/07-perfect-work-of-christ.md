## The Devotion

This is the Almighty Triune God whom has set his loving affections upon you before the creation of heaven and earth. God will never stop loving you because he never started loving you.[^vos]

>Jeremiah 31:3 the LORD appeared to him from far away. I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore, I have continued to extend faithful love to you.*

He is the everlasting to everlasting God who loves from everlasting to everlasting. For his people, for the ones he has always loved, he makes a holy and blessed covenant: to send his only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, God in the flesh, to live and die for his people, whom he has always loved, and bring them all the way home- if only by the Holy Spirit.

And this is the Christ, the Worthy Lamb Who Was Slain, the blessed sacrifice, whose life, death, and blood cleanse you perfectly from all unrighteousness and sin. God saw you not in your goodness, not in your choosing him, not in your repeating the sinner's prayer, but in fact, he saw you in sin and death--a treasonous rebel! He did not pronounce death for you but life. You had to be saved from your sins. You must be born again. But he did not merely say the proclamation. He backed it up with action. He alone came to save us. He alone executed the grand plan of salvation. From Genesis to Revelation, it would be all him: creating us, even when  we sinned, he preaches good news that he will make all things right with him.

The Christ was sent to take on flesh--to be born of the Virgin Mary. He grew like any other person — in wisdom, understanding, and stature. But unlike everybody else, he was perfect. Not super good. Not talented. Not never got in trouble. No! He obeyed the holy law of God perfectly and completely. The first Adam--our original father--failed. This second Adam did not fail. And if you think he was just a super-legalistic Pharisee who was good and white-knuckling his way through 33 years of his life, this is where it becomes perfect: he did it with complete joyful communion with the Father.

He was the only human who did not deserve death.

He was the only human who died a perfect man.

His blood was shed to cleanse you from your sins.

That work, the blood sacrifice of the Lamb, was perfect. He perfectly cleansed you and me from our sins. Once and for all.

And here is the good news: to lest you worry and doubt, dear Christian, that he covered your sins when you were born again. But you have sinned. You and I have sinned since we been set free. Why am I sinning more? I confess! I repent! But I keep doing the things I don't want to do.

Dear child, don't you see? The cross of Christ was over 2000 years ago. All of your sins since the cross have always been *future* sins.

Christ has grace for you when he saved you. Christ has grace and forgiveness for all of your life. Christ has rescued you. Christ has you covered perfectly. Christ is in you. Christ is with you. Christ will bring you all the way home.


## The Scriptures

>Leviticus 6:28 A clay pot in which the sin offering is boiled is to be broken; if it is boiled in a bronze vessel, it is to be scoured and rinsed with water.

>Leviticus 16:21–22 Aaron will lay both his hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the Israelites’ iniquities and rebellious acts—all their sins. He is to put them on the goat’s head and send it away into the wilderness by the man appointed for the task. The goat will carry all their iniquities into a desolate land, and the man will release it there.

>Jeremiah 31:34 No longer will one teach his neighbor or his brother, saying, ‘Know the LORD,’ for they will all know me, from the least to the greatest of them” —this is the LORD’s declaration. “For I will forgive their iniquity and never again remember their sin.

>Ezekiel 36:25 I will also sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your impurities and all your idols.

>Matthew 27:20–23 The chief priests and the elders, however, persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to execute Jesus. The governor asked them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” “Barabbas!” they answered. Pilate asked them, “What should I do then with Jesus, who is called Christ?” They all answered, “Crucify him!” Then he said, “Why? What has he done wrong?” But they kept shouting all the more, “Crucify him!”

>Romans 8:3–4 For what the law could not do since it was weakened by the flesh, God did. He condemned sin in the flesh by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh as a sin offering, in order that the law’s requirement would be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.

>Romans 15:3 For even Christ did not please himself. On the contrary, as it is written, The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.

>Titus 3:3–7 For we too were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved by various passions and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, detesting one another. But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for mankind appeared, he saved us—not by works of righteousness that we had done, but according to his mercy—through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit. He poured out his Spirit on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior so that, having been justified by his grace, we may become heirs with the hope of eternal life.

>Hebrews 9:22 According to the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.

>1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

>Revelation 1:5 and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and has set us free from our sins by his blood,

>Revelation 5:9–10 And they sang a new song: You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, because you were slaughtered, and you purchased people for God by your blood from every tribe and language and people and nation. You made them a kingdom and priests to our God, and they will reign on the earth.

>Revelation 7:9–17 After this I looked, and there was a vast multitude from every nation, tribe, people, and language, which no one could number, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were clothed in white robes with palm branches in their hands. And they cried out in a loud voice: Salvation belongs to our God, who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb! All the angels stood around the throne, and along with the elders and the four living creatures they fell facedown before the throne and worshiped God, saying, Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and strength be to our God forever and ever. Amen. Then one of the elders asked me, “Who are these people in white robes, and where did they come from?” I said to him, “Sir, you know.” Then he told me: These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. For this reason they are before the throne of God, and they serve him day and night in his temple. The one seated on the throne will shelter them: They will no longer hunger; they will no longer thirst; the sun will no longer strike them, nor will any scorching heat. For the Lamb who is at the center of the throne will shepherd them; he will guide them to springs of the waters of life, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.
