## The Text

>John 8:2–11 (CSB)  
><sup>2</sup> At dawn he went to the temple again, and all the people were coming to him. He sat down and began to teach them. 
>
><sup>3</sup> Then the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery, making her stand in the center. 
>
><sup>4</sup> “Teacher,” they said to him, “this woman was caught in the act of committing adultery. 
>
><sup>5</sup> In the law Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?” 
>
><sup>6</sup> They asked this to trap him, in order that they might have evidence to accuse him. Jesus stooped down and started writing on the ground with his finger. 
>
><sup>7</sup> When they persisted in questioning him, he stood up and said to them, “The one without sin among you should be the first to throw a stone at her.” 
>
><sup>8</sup> Then he stooped down again and continued writing on the ground. 
>
><sup>9</sup> When they heard this, they left one by one, starting with the older men. Only he was left, with the woman in the center. 
>
><sup>10</sup> When Jesus stood up, he said to her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?” 
>
><sup>11</sup> “No one, Lord,” she answered. “Neither do I condemn you,” said Jesus. “Go, and from now on do not sin anymore.”

## The Devotion

No one could assume that the adulteress then lived a perfect life from this point. No one would speculate that she never sinned again. Yet, in God the Father's eyes, not only forgiven, but rather, she had never sinned because she trusted in the whom the Father had sent.

We could easily write a fictional piece on the adulteress. We want to write that she lived a holy life in Shekinah glory for all of her days on earth. But any person born again longer than a day knows full well that the adulteress sinned. Her own addictions. Her own trauma keeps repeating the cycle of sin. She does not struggle with sin. She does sin. You do not struggle with sin. You do sin. I do not struggle with sin. I do sin. We all do. We have all fallen short of the glory of God. We are not going to be graded on a curve. For:

>Romans 3:23 (CSB) For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.

>James 2:10 (CSB) For whoever keeps the entire law, and yet stumbles at one point, is guilty of breaking it all.

>Galatians 3:10 (CSB) For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, because it is written: Everyone who does not do everything written in the book of the law is cursed.

Wretched man that I am! A wretched woman that she was! She did sinned. I will sin. That same sin that I have been forgiven of, I will do. Will there be condemnation in my future?

We cannot speculate on the adulteress--what sins she committed. But I will tell you this: I know that I know she had the Holy Spirit dwelling in her because God the Father had mercy on her, forgave her, and made his home in her. I know this because the Son of God, who is God, did not condemn her but died for her in her place for her sin.

We know that the adulteress sinned. But we also know that because she had the Holy Spirit dwelling in her, the Father gave her the gift of repentance. And time and time again, no matter how deep the sin, Christ was instantly able and willing to forgive her.

>1 John 1:9 (CSB) If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

Turn to Christ, and you will be instantly forgiven. Not a drop of wrath is reserved for you--Christ drank the cup of wrath in full. Not a bit of condemnation is held back for you for your future sins--when Christ died, all of your sins were future sins. You are secured. You are sealed. You are set free. You are forgiven. You are loved. You are a child of God.

>Oh close and blessed union! Justified by God, accepted in Christ, condemnation there cannot be. I stand in the Divine presence as Joshua stood before the Lord, or as the woman stood before the Savior, charged, accused, guilty; but I am in the presence of him who, though now he sits upon the throne as my Judge, once hung upon the cross as my Savior. And, investing me with his own spotless robe, he proceeds to pronounce the sentence- "NO CONDEMNATION!"
>
>"These things write I unto you that your joy may be full."
>
>Octavius Winslow. No Condemnation in Christ Jesus. 191.

The adulteress turned the Christ when she sinned because Christ came to save us from our sins. The adulteress was bondage to corruption and Christ the Firstborn came to make her a child of God and give her the freedom that only belongs to the children of God. The adulteress was the worst of sinners! But didn't Christ come to save even the chief of sinners?

That's her. That's you. That's me.

But God loved us.

>Romans 5:6-8 (CSB) For while we were still helpless, at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly. For rarely will someone die for a just person — though for a good person perhaps someone might even dare to die. <span class="bgy">But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</span>

But God loved us.

>Romans 5:10 (CSB) For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, then how much more, having been reconciled, will we be saved by his life!

But God loved us.

>1 John 4:10 (CSB) Love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins.

But God loved us.

>Galatians 2:20 (CSB) I have been crucified with Christ, and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.

We sinned but God loved us.

>Psalm 103:8-14 (CSB)  
>The LORD is compassionate and gracious,  
>slow to anger and abounding in faithful love.  
>He will not always accuse us  
>or be angry forever.  
>He has not dealt with us as our sins deserve  
>or repaid us according to our iniquities.  
>For as high as the heavens are above the earth,  
>so great is his faithful love  
>toward those who fear him.  
>As far as the east is from the west,  
>so far has he removed  
>our transgressions from us.  
>As a father has compassion on his children,  
>so the LORD has compassion on those who fear him.  
>For he knows what we are made of,  
>remembering that we are dust.

We keep sinning, but God keeps loving us.

>Titus 3:3–7 (CSB) For we too were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved by various passions and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, detesting one another. But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for mankind appeared, he saved us—not by works of righteousness that we had done, but according to his mercy—through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit. He poured out his Spirit on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior so that, having been justified by his grace, we may become heirs with the hope of eternal life.

We have forever broken the law of God but God will forever love us.

>Ephesians 2:1–10 (CSB) And you were dead in your trespasses and sins in which you previously walked according to the ways of this world, according to the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit now working in the disobedient. We too all previously lived among them in our fleshly desires, carrying out the inclinations of our flesh and thoughts, and we were by nature children under wrath as the others were also. But God, who is rich in mercy, because of his great love that he had for us, made us alive with Christ even though we were dead in trespasses. You are saved by grace! He also raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavens in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages he might display the immeasurable riches of his grace through his kindness to us in Christ Jesus. For you are saved by grace through faith, and this is not from yourselves; it is God’s gift—not from works, so that no one can boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared ahead of time for us to do.

My child, God will never stop loving you because he never started loving you. 

>Ephesians 1:3–14 (CSB) Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavens in Christ. For he chose us in him, before the foundation of the world, to be holy and blameless in love before him. He predestined us to be adopted as sons through Jesus Christ for himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace that he lavished on us in the Beloved One. In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace that he richly poured out on us with all wisdom and understanding. He made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure that he purposed in Christ as a plan for the right time—to bring everything together in Christ, both things in heaven and things on earth in him. In him we have also received an inheritance, because we were predestined according to the plan of the one who works out everything in agreement with the purpose of his will, so that we who had already put our hope in Christ might bring praise to his glory. In him you also were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and when you believed. The Holy Spirit is the down payment of our inheritance, until the redemption of the possession, to the praise of his glory.

This is the great love of God.

>John 3:14–17 (CSB) “Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. For God loved the world in this way: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.

And there is nothing that will come between you and the Triune God.

>Romans 8:36–39 (CSB) As it is written: Because of you we are being put to death all day long; we are counted as sheep to be slaughtered. No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Christ is forever for you. Blessed be his name forever and ever. Amen.

## The Scriptures

>1 John 4:7–21 (CSB)  
><sup>7</sup> Dear friends, let us love one another, because love is from God, and everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. 
>
><sup>8</sup> The one who does not love does not know God, because God is love. 
>
><sup>9</sup> God’s love was revealed among us in this way: God sent his one and only Son into the world so that we might live through him. 
>
><sup>10</sup> Love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins. 
>
><sup>11</sup> Dear friends, if God loved us in this way, we also must love one another. 
>
><sup>12</sup> No one has ever seen God. If we love one another, God remains in us and his love is made complete in us. 
>
><sup>13</sup> This is how we know that we remain in him and he in us: He has given us of his Spirit. 
>
><sup>14</sup> And we have seen and we testify that the Father has sent his Son as the world’s Savior. 
>
><sup>15</sup> Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God—God remains in him and he in God. 
>
><sup>16</sup> And we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and the one who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him. 
>
><sup>17</sup> In this, love is made complete with us so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment, because as he is, so also are we in this world. 
>
><sup>18</sup> There is no fear in love; instead, perfect love drives out fear, because fear involves punishment. So the one who fears is not complete in love. 
>
><sup>19</sup> We love because he first loved us. 
>
><sup>20</sup> If anyone says, “I love God,” and yet hates his brother or sister, he is a liar. For the person who does not love his brother or sister whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen. 
>
><sup>21</sup> And we have this command from him: The one who loves God must also love his brother and sister.

>Lamentations 3:22–24 (CSB) Because of the LORD’s faithful love we do not perish, for his mercies never end. They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness! I say, “The LORD is my portion, therefore I will put my hope in him.”

Do not bow in worship to them, and do not serve them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, bringing the consequences of the fathers’ iniquity on the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate me, but showing faithful love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commands.

>Exodus 34:6–7 (CSB) The LORD passed in front of him and proclaimed: The LORD—the LORD is a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger and abounding in faithful love and truth, maintaining faithful love to a thousand generations, forgiving iniquity, rebellion, and sin. But he will not leave the guilty unpunished, bringing the consequences of the fathers’ iniquity on the children and grandchildren to the third and fourth generation.

Please pardon the iniquity of this people, in keeping with the greatness of your faithful love, just as you have forgiven them from Egypt until now.”

>Deuteronomy 7:12–13 (CSB) “If you listen to and are careful to keep these ordinances, the LORD your God will keep his covenant loyalty with you, as he swore to your ancestors.

On that day I will make a covenant for them with the wild animals, the birds of the sky, and the creatures that crawl on the ground. I will shatter bow, sword, and weapons of war in the land and will enable the people to rest securely. I will take you to be my wife forever. I will take you to be my wife in righteousness, justice, love, and compassion. I will take you to be my wife in faithfulness, and you will know the LORD. On that day I will respond— this is the LORD’s declaration. I will respond to the sky, and it will respond to the earth. The earth will respond to the grain, the new wine, and the fresh oil, and they will respond to Jezreel. I will sow her in the land for myself, and I will have compassion on Lo-ruhamah; I will say to Lo-ammi: You are my people, and he will say, “You are my God.”
