## The Text

>John 3:14–17 (CSB) “Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. For God loved the world in this way: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.

>Galatians 2:20 (CSB) I have been crucified with Christ, and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.

>Romans 5:6-8 (CSB) For while we were still helpless, at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly. For rarely will someone die for a just person — though for a good person perhaps someone might even dare to die. <span class="bgy">But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</span>

## The Devotion

## The Scriptures

>1 John 4:7–21 (CSB)  
><sup>7</sup> Dear friends, let us love one another, because love is from God, and everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. 
>
><sup>8</sup> The one who does not love does not know God, because God is love. 
>
><sup>9</sup> God’s love was revealed among us in this way: God sent his one and only Son into the world so that we might live through him. 
>
><sup>10</sup> Love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins. 
>
><sup>11</sup> Dear friends, if God loved us in this way, we also must love one another. 
>
><sup>12</sup> No one has ever seen God. If we love one another, God remains in us and his love is made complete in us. 
>
><sup>13</sup> This is how we know that we remain in him and he in us: He has given us of his Spirit. 
>
><sup>14</sup> And we have seen and we testify that the Father has sent his Son as the world’s Savior. 
>
><sup>15</sup> Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God—God remains in him and he in God. 
>
><sup>16</sup> And we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and the one who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him. 
>
><sup>17</sup> In this, love is made complete with us so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment, because as he is, so also are we in this world. 
>
><sup>18</sup> There is no fear in love; instead, perfect love drives out fear, because fear involves punishment. So the one who fears is not complete in love. 
>
><sup>19</sup> We love because he first loved us. 
>
><sup>20</sup> If anyone says, “I love God,” and yet hates his brother or sister, he is a liar. For the person who does not love his brother or sister whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen. 
>
><sup>21</sup> And we have this command from him: The one who loves God must also love his brother and sister.

>Lamentations 3:22–24 (CSB) Because of the LORD’s faithful love we do not perish, for his mercies never end. They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness! I say, “The LORD is my portion, therefore I will put my hope in him.”

Do not bow in worship to them, and do not serve them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, bringing the consequences of the fathers’ iniquity on the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate me, but showing faithful love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commands.

>Exodus 34:6–7 (CSB) The LORD passed in front of him and proclaimed: The LORD—the LORD is a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger and abounding in faithful love and truth, maintaining faithful love to a thousand generations, forgiving iniquity, rebellion, and sin. But he will not leave the guilty unpunished, bringing the consequences of the fathers’ iniquity on the children and grandchildren to the third and fourth generation.

Please pardon the iniquity of this people, in keeping with the greatness of your faithful love, just as you have forgiven them from Egypt until now.”

>Deuteronomy 7:12–13 (CSB) “If you listen to and are careful to keep these ordinances, the LORD your God will keep his covenant loyalty with you, as he swore to your ancestors.

On that day I will make a covenant for them with the wild animals, the birds of the sky, and the creatures that crawl on the ground. I will shatter bow, sword, and weapons of war in the land and will enable the people to rest securely. I will take you to be my wife forever. I will take you to be my wife in righteousness, justice, love, and compassion. I will take you to be my wife in faithfulness, and you will know the LORD. On that day I will respond— this is the LORD’s declaration. I will respond to the sky, and it will respond to the earth. The earth will respond to the grain, the new wine, and the fresh oil, and they will respond to Jezreel. I will sow her in the land for myself, and I will have compassion on Lo-ruhamah; I will say to Lo-ammi: You are my people, and he will say, “You are my God.”
