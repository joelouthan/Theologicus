# Sufficient Work of Christ--We Are Clean

## The Text

>1 John 1:7–9 (CSB) If we walk in the light as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. If we say, “We have no sin,” we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

**My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!**  
**My sin, not in part but the whole**  
**Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more**  
**Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, o my soul!**
