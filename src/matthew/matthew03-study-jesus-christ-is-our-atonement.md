# Matthew 3 Jesus Christ Our Atonement

*Trying to answer the question, "How is Jesus Christ our All-in-all?*

## Matthew 3:1-6 Jesus Christ is Our Proclamation

### The Text

>Matthew 3:1–6 (CSB)  
><sup> 1 </sup> In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea
>
><sup> 2 </sup> and saying, “Repent, because the kingdom of heaven has come near!”
>
><sup> 3 </sup> For he is the one spoken of through the prophet Isaiah, who said: A voice of one crying out in the wilderness: Prepare the way for the Lord; make his paths straight!
>
><sup> 4 </sup> Now John had a camel-hair garment with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
>
><sup> 5 </sup> Then people from Jerusalem, all Judea, and all the vicinity of the Jordan were going out to him,
>
><sup> 6 </sup> and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.

### The Devotion

Christ has not commanded you to do anything you can do in your own power. He is calling sinners to repentance--that is you and me. Unbelievers cannot repent of their sins unless the Triune God dwells in them and have been given a new heart and the gift of repentance by God himself.

>Acts 11:18 (CSB) When they heard this they became silent. And they glorified God, saying, “So then, God has given repentance resulting in life even to the Gentiles.”

>2 Timothy 2:25 (CSB) instructing his opponents with gentleness. Perhaps God will grant them repentance leading them to the knowledge of the truth.

>Hebrews 12:17 (CSB) For you know that later, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected because he didn’t find any opportunity for repentance, though he sought it with tears.

Christ sums it all up:

>John 3:3 (CSB) Jesus replied, “Truly I tell you, unless someone is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”

You and I--the elect, saved, and adopted children of God--are called by God, empowered by God, indwelt by God, transformed by God, raised from death by God, made alive by God, given eyes to see, ears to hear, renewed mind to understand, a tongue unmute, and oh yea, the Eternal Almighty Spirit and the Only Begotten Son of God. Within this, you have been given the faith to believe in God. Within that, you have been given the gift of repentance in order to turn away from your sins and turn back to God.

Christ has come to you and me so that we can repent from our sins and turn and follow him.

You must be born again!

## Matthew 3:7-12 Jesus Christ is Our Repentance

### The Text

>Matthew 3:7–12 (CSB)  
><sup>7</sup> When he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, “Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 
>
><sup>8</sup> Therefore produce fruit consistent with repentance. 
>
><sup>9</sup> And don’t presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones. 
>
><sup>10</sup> The ax is already at the root of the trees. Therefore, every tree that doesn’t produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. 
>
><sup>11</sup> “I baptize you with water for repentance, but the one who is coming after me is more powerful than I. I am not worthy to remove his sandals. He himself will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. 
>
><sup>12</sup> His winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn. But the chaff he will burn with fire that never goes out.”

### The Devotion

>John 1:12–13 (CSB) But to all who did receive him, he gave them the right to be children of God, to those who believe in his name, who were born, not of natural descent, or of the will of the flesh, or of the will of man, but of God.

>1 John 5:1 (CSB) Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father also loves the one born of him.

If we are command by God empowered by God to turn to God and be with God, don't think for a moment that you and I can obey God without God. It is impossible.

>John 15:5 (CSB) “I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in me and I in him produces much fruit, because you can do nothing without me.

I saw a disturbing poll just the other day. It was on the Internet so it must be true. Evangelicals were asked a basic question, "What is more prevalent problem im the church: the carnal 'Christian' who claims faith and yet goes on continuing to sin or is it is the legalistic 'Christian' who claims to be believes but strives to gain favor with God?" What do you think our brothers and sister said? You guessed it! "Oh the carnal Christian. There are church pews that are filled with those who come rolling in on the Sunday morning fresh from the strip clubs the night before."

The church never thinks that legalism is an issue within the church because why? Here is the unsaid reason, "At least people are doing good things and not bad things." And do not misunderstand me: that is a good thing when it comes to the order and chaos of our lives. But does doing good things earn you any favor with God? We all know the correct answer but how do we live and think and give mercy to one another.

We all thing that legalism is not an issue but Christ called legalists, "brood of vipers", "hypocrites", "whitewashed tombs", "vipers", and the Almighty God proclaiming "woe to you". (Matthew 23)

We, as mankind, give a free pass to legalism. In the eyes of Jesus Christ, the legalist and the carnal man are one and the same. They are both dead in their sins and trespasses. They are both in need of a Savior. They are both in need of repentance. They are both in need of the Holy Spirit. They are both in need of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

## Matthew 3:13-17 Jesus Christ is Our Satisfaction

### The Text

>Matthew 3:13–17 (CSB)  
><sup>13</sup> Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan, to be baptized by him. 
>
><sup>14</sup> But John tried to stop him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and yet you come to me?” 
>
><sup>15</sup> Jesus answered him, “Allow it for now, because this is the way for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then John allowed him to be baptized. 
>
><sup>16</sup> When Jesus was baptized, he went up immediately from the water. The heavens suddenly opened for him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming down on him. 
>
><sup>17</sup> And a voice from heaven said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well-pleased.”

### The Devotion

My brother and sister, you will never hear, "Depart from me, you worker of lawlessness!"

Because only the workers of lawlessness are so foolish in their pride and legalistic efforts to extract the blessings of God without God himself. They are so wicked and sinful, they would dare approach the throne of grace and proclaim to God, "Look at me! See what I have done!"

You, my beloved, will stand before the throne. You will see the Christ lifted on high. Your eternal Savior and your blessed Messiah! And he will be at the right hand of your heavenly Father. You cannot speak! You stand in the presence of whom the angels rightfully proclaim, "Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord God Almighty!"

But how can you defend yourself? How can you make account for yourself? You see, you are not worthy to declare such things. 

You are going to need someone who is worthy and holy and righteous to be your declaration and defense.

>Romans 8:16 (CSB) The Spirit himself testifies together with our spirit that we are God’s children,

>1 John 5:6–8 (CSB) Jesus Christ—He is the One who came by water and blood, not by water only, but by water and by blood. And the Spirit is the One who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. For there are three that testify: the Spirit, the water, and the blood—and these three are in agreement.

>1 John 2:1 (CSB) My little children, I am writing you these things so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ the Righteous One.

The blessed Triune God will be your declaration. The Spirit is your adoption and bond with God. Your Father will declare for all of creation to know, "THIS IS MY CHILD IN WHOM I AM WELL PLEASED!"

This is when Christ descends from his judgment thorn, runs over to you, gather you up in his robe and in arms, and proceeds to pass the final judgment:

"NO CONDEMNATION! Come and enter into the joy of your Master!"

>Psalm 17:15 (CSB) But I will see your face in righteousness; when I awake, I will be satisfied with your presence.
