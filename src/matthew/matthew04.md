# Matthew 4

><sup>1</sup> Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. 
>
><sup>2</sup> After he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry. 
>
><sup>3</sup> Then the tempter approached him and said, “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.” 
>
><sup>4</sup> He answered, “It is written: Man must not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.” 
>
><sup>5</sup> Then the devil took him to the holy city, had him stand on the pinnacle of the temple, 
>
><sup>6</sup> and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written: He will give his angels orders concerning you, and they will support you with their hands so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.” 
>
><sup>7</sup> Jesus told him, “It is also written: Do not test the Lord your God.” 
>
><sup>8</sup> Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor. 
>
><sup>9</sup> And he said to him, “I will give you all these things if you will fall down and worship me.” 
>
><sup>10</sup> Then Jesus told him, “Go away, Satan! For it is written: Worship the Lord your God, and serve only him.” 
>
><sup>11</sup> Then the devil left him, and angels came and began to serve him. 
>
><sup>12</sup> When he heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee. 
>
><sup>13</sup> He left Nazareth and went to live in Capernaum by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali. 
>
><sup>14</sup> This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: 
>
><sup>15</sup> Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, along the road by the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles. 
>
><sup>16</sup> The people who live in darkness have seen a great light, and for those living in the land of the shadow of death, a light has dawned. 
>
><sup>17</sup> From then on Jesus began to preach, “Repent, because the kingdom of heaven has come near.” 
>
><sup>18</sup> As he was walking along the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (who is called Peter), and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea—for they were fishermen. 
>
><sup>19</sup> “Follow me,” he told them, “and I will make you fish for people.” 
>
><sup>20</sup> Immediately they left their nets and followed him. 
>
><sup>21</sup> Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with Zebedee their father, preparing their nets, and he called them. 
>
><sup>22</sup> Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him. 
>
><sup>23</sup> Now Jesus began to go all over Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people. 
>
><sup>24</sup> Then the news about him spread throughout Syria. So they brought to him all those who were afflicted, those suffering from various diseases and intense pains, the demon-possessed, the epileptics, and the paralytics. And he healed them. 
>
><sup>25</sup> Large crowds followed him from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan.
