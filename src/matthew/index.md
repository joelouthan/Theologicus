# Matthew

## The Introduction

So why start up a new series? Do I need another series like I need another hole in my head? Perhaps.

We moved to Kentucky from Oklahoma in early 2022 with my in-laws coming with. I started this series in anticipation that we might not find a local church instantly and wanted to be prepared from the jump not going to church for a long while. Keeping it all the way real with you: I knew my in-laws would be slow going to church and wanted to provide the word of God to them. [^prayer]

We did end up finding a church April and have been faithfully attending. It was God's grace I started this series and his grace, I will finish it.

### An Update

I need y'all to look at God! What he started, he will finish!

I just finished teaching my [first series](../ruth/index.md) at my church, [Reforming Truth (Lexington, KY)](https://theologic.us/) and was giving some thought on what my next series will be. 

Matthew seems as natural as the next step because:

- The end of Ruth is the beginning of Matthew. That is, the genealogy of Jesus.
- Still building on and running with what the elders were teaching through: Chad Bird's [The Christ Key](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58373755-the-christ-key).
- Lastly, I prepped the entire book of Matthew already. I just need to write it out.
