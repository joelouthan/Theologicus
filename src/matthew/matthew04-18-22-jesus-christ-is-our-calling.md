## The Devotion

### Called by Christ--Christ is Our Calling

When I speak of the calling of God, what do I mean? Many times in the modern era, we take the calling of God on our lives as what has God called us to do--minister, missionary, business owner, IT worker, stay at home mom, executive director--in other words, the vocation by God for us. What is the work that God has for us to do. But that is a discussion for another time.

I want us to think about the effectual calling of God on the people of God. When God calls us from death to life (Ephesians 2:1-10), it is raising us from death in sin to life in him. We can debate the tenets of free will of man versus sovereignty of God all the live long day. But no person in the world will argue against the fact that dead people do not make choices. They are dead.

>Ephesians 2:1 (CSB) And you were dead in your trespasses and sins

In the beautiful lovely grace of God sought us out, called us from death to life, he saved us.

And what is so wonderful about that is the consistency of the gospel between the Old and New Testament. The gospel was always the power of God in salvation for those who believe--to the Jew first and also the Greek (Romans 1:16). But we know, being New Testament saints, we know that good news is found in the Jesus Christ our Lord.

Our brothers and sisters from before Christ came? They didn't know. They didn't know of Jesus Christ. They had plenty of clues--foreshadows given to the people of God by God that God alone will make all things right with himself. Trust in him and be saved.

The very fact that the Son of God puts on flesh and dwelt among us (John 1:14) the completion and the start of every calling by God to his people. Completion because all of the calling of the Old Testament saints prior to the incarnation of Christ was in some ways a gospel mystery. The Old Testament saints were called by God and received the good news, they believed and it was counted to them as righteousness (Genesis 15:6; Romans 4:3). But how God was going to save them was still a mystery. The calling of God was there, and they were saved and it was not incomplete--just mysterious.

"But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for mankind appeared, he saved us" (Titus 3:4-5 (CSB) The moment that God our Savior appeared in the flesh, the callings of God to save us from our sin made sense. The callings themselves were no longer mysterious. When Abraham and the saints of old who were in the Paradise at the time of Christ saw the day when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for mankind appeared--when Word became flesh and dwelt among us--and saved us"? They rejoiced! (John 8:55) Their calling made sense. Their calling was no longer mysterious. The mystery was revealed. How was God going to save us from our sins? Jesus Christ, the Son of God who is God, is the answer! Just look upon the Risen Son and be saved!

And these disciples, the first of many grains of sand (Genesis 22:17, Isaiah 48:19, Hebrews 11:12) were called by the Living God to come follow him. We might see this as an mere natural observers and think, "Oh surely, yes, the choose to follow him." But to the sons of God, you and me, who have the indwelling of the Spirit, who can now understand the free gifts of God (1 Corinthians 2:12), we see this as the Christ calling dead men to life.

Christ is the calling of God for our salvation. Respond to his command, "Follow me, repent, for the kingdom of God is now!" and be saved.

You and I have been made alive together with Christ. Glorify his name forever. Amen.
