# Matthew 3:13-17 Jesus Christ is Our Satisfaction

*Trying to answer the question, "How is Jesus Christ our All-in-all?*

## The Text

>Matthew 3:13–17 (CSB)  
><sup>13</sup> Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan, to be baptized by him. 
>
><sup>14</sup> But John tried to stop him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and yet you come to me?” 
>
><sup>15</sup> Jesus answered him, “Allow it for now, because this is the way for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then John allowed him to be baptized. 
>
><sup>16</sup> When Jesus was baptized, he went up immediately from the water. The heavens suddenly opened for him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming down on him. 
>
><sup>17</sup> And a voice from heaven said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well-pleased.”

## The Devotion

My brother and sister, you will never hear, "Depart from me, you worker of lawlessness!"

Because only the workers of lawlessness are so foolish in their pride and legalistic efforts to extract the blessings of God without God himself. They are so wicked and sinful, they would dare approach the throne of grace and proclaim to God, "Look at me! See what I have done!"

You, my beloved, will stand before the throne. You will see the Christ lifted on high. Your eternal Savior and your blessed Messiah! And he will be at the right hand of your heavenly Father. You cannot speak! You stand in the presence of whom the angels rightfully proclaim, "Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord God Almighty!"

But how can you defend yourself? How can you make account for yourself? You see, you are not worthy to declare such things. 

You are going to need someone who is worthy and holy and righteous to be your declaration and defense.

>Romans 8:16 (CSB) The Spirit himself testifies together with our spirit that we are God’s children,

>1 John 5:6–8 (CSB) Jesus Christ—He is the One who came by water and blood, not by water only, but by water and by blood. And the Spirit is the One who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. For there are three that testify: the Spirit, the water, and the blood—and these three are in agreement.

>1 John 2:1 (CSB) My little children, I am writing you these things so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ the Righteous One.

The blessed Triune God will be your declaration. The Spirit is your adoption and bond with God. Your Father will declare for all of creation to know, "THIS IS MY CHILD IN WHOM I AM WELL PLEASED!"

This is when Christ descends from his judgment thorn, runs over to you, gather you up in his robe and in arms, and proceeds to pass the final judgment:

"NO CONDEMNATION! Come and enter into the joy of your Master!"

>Psalm 17:15 (CSB) But I will see your face in righteousness; when I awake, I will be satisfied with your presence.
