# Matthew 2 Jesus Christ is Our King

*Trying to answer the question, "How is Jesus Christ our All-in-all?*

## Matthew 2:1-12 He is Our Ruler

### The Text

>Matthew 2:1–12 (CSB)  
><sup> 1 </sup> After Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, <bgy>wise men</bgy> from the east arrived in Jerusalem,
>
><sup> 2 </sup> saying, “Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star at its rising and have come to worship him.”
>
><sup> 3 </sup> When King Herod heard this, he was deeply disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
>
><sup> 4 </sup> So he assembled all the chief priests and scribes of the people and asked them where the Messiah would be born.
>
><sup> 5 </sup> “In Bethlehem of Judea,” they told him, “because this is what was written by the prophet:
>
><sup> 6 </sup> And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah: Because out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.”
>
><sup> 7 </sup> Then Herod secretly summoned the wise men and asked them the exact time the star appeared.
>
><sup> 8 </sup> He sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go and search carefully for the child. When you find him, report back to me so that I too can go and worship him.”
>
><sup> 9 </sup> After hearing the king, they went on their way. And there it was—the star they had seen at its rising. It led them until it came and stopped above the place where the child was.
>
><sup> 10 </sup> When they saw the star, they were overwhelmed with joy.
>
><sup> 11 </sup> Entering the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and falling to their knees, they worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
>
><sup> 12 </sup> And being warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their own country by another route.

## The Devotion

### People want a king and not the King

>1 Samuel 8:4-7 (CSB) So all the elders of Israel gathered together and went to Samuel at Ramah. They said to him, “Look, you are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Therefore, appoint a king to judge us the same as all the other nations have.”When they said, “Give us a king to judge us,” Samuel considered their demand wrong, so he prayed to the LORD. But the LORD told him, “Listen to the people and everything they say to you. They have not rejected you; they have rejected me as their king.

### A line of sinful kings yet God establishes

*The satanic worship of the wise men*

*The madness of Herod & the madness of the pharaoh* Romans 9

*The reserved worship for God*  
  *To the Jew first (Mary & Joseph) and to the Greek (Gentiles of the Wise Men)*

>2 Samuel 7:16 (CSB) Your house and kingdom will endure before me forever, and your throne will be established forever.

God promises this through will be established forever *before* David rapes Bathsheba and murders Uriah.

### Jesus is born and he is King of kings

Jesus was born under the grotesquely evil King Herod. That was not a mistake.

Who set King Herod to rule?

>Daniel 2:19-21 (CSB) The mystery was then revealed to Daniel in a vision at night, and Daniel praised the God of the heavens and declared:  
>May the name of God  
>be praised forever and ever,  
>for wisdom and power belong to him.  
>He changes the times and seasons;  
>he removes kings and establishes kings.  
>He gives wisdom to the wise  
>and knowledge to those  
>who have understanding.

Jesus Christ, son of God, who is God, who is the King of kings and Lord of lords, and he is ruling and reigning over all creation--born to a poor, working class, family under the tyranny of a evil king.

God established the throne of David. Despite the brokenness of our world, God stopped at nothing to save his people from their sins.

And it starts with completing what he promised to David so many centuries before.

#### The three strange gifts

*Gold* A gift for a king. Jesus is our king.

*Frankincense* - used in Jewish worship. The frankincense was used in the temple worship. It was a gift for a priest. The aroma and fragrance of the prayers of His people to God. Jesus is our great high priest.

*Myrrh* - used in burial. Jesus is our sacrifice.

## Matthew 2:13-18 He is Our Eternal Word

### The Text

>Matthew 2:13–18 (CSB)  
><sup> 13 </sup> After they were gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, “Get up! Take the child and his mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you. For Herod is about to search for the child to kill him.”
>
><sup> 14 </sup> So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night, and escaped to Egypt.
>
><sup> 15 </sup> He stayed there until Herod’s death, so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled: Out of Egypt I called my Son.
>
><sup> 16 </sup> Then Herod, when he realized that he had been outwitted by the wise men, flew into a rage. He gave orders to massacre all the boys in and around Bethlehem who were two years old and under, in keeping with the time he had learned from the wise men.
>
><sup> 17 </sup> Then what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled:
>
><sup> 18 </sup> A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children; and she refused to be consoled, because they are no more.

>Jeremiah 31:15 (CSB) This is what the LORD says: A voice was heard in Ramah, a lament with bitter weeping— Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted for her children because they are no more.

### The Devotion - The Gift of Worship

>John 10:14-18 (CSB) “I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and my own know me, just as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep. But I have other sheep that are not from this sheep pen; I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. Then there will be one flock, one shepherd. This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life so that I may take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down on my own. I have the right to lay it down, and I have the right to take it up again. I have received this command from my Father.”

>Matthew 26:52-54 (CSB) Then Jesus told him, “Put your sword back in its place because all who take up the sword will perish by the sword. Or do you think that I cannot call on my Father, and he will provide me here and now with more than twelve legions of angels? How, then, would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen this way?

One of the things that we might have a hard time comprehending is the eternal word of God. When we speak about something we want to do, we say it, then do it, and then it will be true.

God does not operate in that way.

What He says, in any moment of time, is true not only for the moment it was spoken and forever in the future but any moment prior to that moment.

Think of all the Old Testament saints--by definition, these are all the saints prior to the cross of Christ. How were they saved? How were all the believing Jews were saved?

>Genesis 3:15 (CSB) I will put hostility between you and the woman,  
>and between your offspring and her offspring.  
>He will strike your head,  
>and you will strike his heel.

This first instance of the gospel was given to our first parents: Adam and Eve. From that moment, God does not change it but he reveals more of  promise--the good news that He will make it everything right with himself who along is good and right and true and holy.

The fullness of the gospel was not completed until Jesus died on the cross. But the details of the gospel did not have to be realized by any of the Old Testament saints.

>Romans 3:25-26 (CSB) God presented him as the mercy seat by his blood, through faith, to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his restraint God passed over the sins previously committed. God presented him to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so that he would be just and justify the one who has faith in Jesus.

Jesus Christ, Son of God who is God, is the Eternal Word. When God speaks, it is true, will always be true, and was forever true from before the beginning.

We know that his promises are always yes and amen. Because God as declared his good news, we believe and therefore, we are counted as righteousness in the sight of God. Now, our prayers--our words to God are not ignored, dismissed, or merely "one ear and out the other", but our words are a sweet aroma to God. God hears us so hard, he inhales our every word and thought.

## Matthew 2:19-23 He Numbers Our Days

### The Text

>Matthew 2:19-23 (CSB) After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, because those who intended to kill the child are dead.” So he got up, took the child and his mother, and entered the land of Israel. But when he heard that Archelaus was ruling over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee. Then he went and settled in a town called Nazareth to fulfill what was spoken through the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene.

### The Devotion - The Gift of Myrrh

*We read Revelation 21 and know that Christ could have come in full glory? But why in the most vulnerable state?*

Christ at his infancy and most vulnerable. Yet, he was not ready to give his life up to save ours. That time has not come. It will only come if God brings it to past.

No matter the danger he was in, Christ remain invincible. The Evangelist George Whitefield said it best:

>We are immortal until our work on earth is done.

>Job 14:5 (CSB) Since a person’s days are determined  
>and the number of his months depends on you,  
>and since you have set limits he cannot pass,

>Hebrews 9:27 (CSB) And just as it is appointed for people to die once — and after this, judgment —

If the days of Christ are numbered, how can we be anything less? If we are in Christ, we remain invincible until God's work is done and he brings us home.

Jesus Christ, fully God and fully man, did not live a life without fear or alarm. From while he was in his mother's womb, he lived a dangerous life. But His days were numbered until the moment He perfectly saved His people from their sins.

>We must always bear in mind the purpose of God, in training his Son, from the commencement, under the discipline of the cross, because this was the way in which he was to redeem his Church. He bore our infirmities, and was exposed to dangers and to fears, that he might deliver his Church from them by his divine power, and might bestow upon it everlasting peace. His danger was our safety: his fear was our confidence.
>
>John Calvin. Commentary on Matthew.

Like Christ, our works of God have been laid out for us by God. Go and complete that work to the glory of God.
