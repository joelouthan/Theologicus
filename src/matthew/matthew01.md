# Matthew 1

*Trying to answer the question, "How is Jesus Christ our All-in-all?*

><sup>1</sup> An account of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham: 
>
><sup>2</sup> Abraham fathered Isaac, Isaac fathered Jacob, Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers, 
>
><sup>3</sup> Judah fathered Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez fathered Hezron, Hezron fathered Aram, 
>
><sup>4</sup> Aram fathered Amminadab, Amminadab fathered Nahshon, Nahshon fathered Salmon, 
>
><sup>5</sup> Salmon fathered Boaz by Rahab, Boaz fathered Obed by Ruth, Obed fathered Jesse, 
>
><sup>6</sup> and Jesse fathered King David. David fathered Solomon by Uriah’s wife, 
>
><sup>7</sup> Solomon fathered Rehoboam, Rehoboam fathered Abijah, Abijah fathered Asa, 
>
><sup>8</sup> Asa fathered Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat fathered Joram, Joram fathered Uzziah, 
>
><sup>9</sup> Uzziah fathered Jotham, Jotham fathered Ahaz, Ahaz fathered Hezekiah, 
>
><sup>10</sup> Hezekiah fathered Manasseh, Manasseh fathered Amon, Amon fathered Josiah, 
>
><sup>11</sup> and Josiah fathered Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon. 
>
><sup>12</sup> After the exile to Babylon Jeconiah fathered Shealtiel, Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel, 
>
><sup>13</sup> Zerubbabel fathered Abiud, Abiud fathered Eliakim, Eliakim fathered Azor, 
>
><sup>14</sup> Azor fathered Zadok, Zadok fathered Achim, Achim fathered Eliud, 
>
><sup>15</sup> Eliud fathered Eleazar, Eleazar fathered Matthan, Matthan fathered Jacob, 
>
><sup>16</sup> and Jacob fathered Joseph the husband of Mary, who gave birth to Jesus who is called the Messiah. 
>
><sup>17</sup> So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations; and from David until the exile to Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the exile to Babylon until the Messiah, fourteen generations. 
>
><sup>18</sup> The birth of Jesus Christ came about this way: After his mother Mary had been engaged to Joseph, it was discovered before they came together that she was pregnant from the Holy Spirit. 
>
><sup>19</sup> So her husband, Joseph, being a righteous man, and not wanting to disgrace her publicly, decided to divorce her secretly. 
>
><sup>20</sup> But after he had considered these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, don’t be afraid to take Mary as your wife, because what has been conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. 
>
><sup>21</sup> She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.” 
>
><sup>22</sup> Now all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet: 
>
><sup>23</sup> See, the virgin will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and they will name him Immanuel, which is translated “God is with us.” 
>
><sup>24</sup> When Joseph woke up, he did as the Lord’s angel had commanded him. He married her 
>
><sup>25</sup> but did not have sexual relations with her until she gave birth to a son. And he named him Jesus.
