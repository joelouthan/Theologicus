# Versioning

Semantic Versioning will be as following:

- MAJOR: New technology. In other words, as long as I using mdBook, Theologicus will remain in version 3.x.x.
- MINOR: New **finished** exposition series. When the series is complete, this will bump up version from 3.0 to 3.1, for example.
- PATCH: New sermons or new articles. This will go from 3.0.0 to 3.0.1 to 3.0.2 and so on.
