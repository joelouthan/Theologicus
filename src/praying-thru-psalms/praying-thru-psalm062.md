## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
You Are My Rest
</div>


Most of my life
  I have fought against you
  blasphemed your holy name
  was slave to my own lusts
  continue to hating everybody
  and including myself.

But with all of my life
  you set your affections upon me
  loved me with love I have never known
  gave me grace everywhere
  and was so merciful and kind towards me
  despite my anger and rage and sin against you

I still cannot believe
  that you would love me
  at my very worst
  in my darkest pain
  in my deepest shame
  you saw me
  knowing I was dead
  and brought me to life.

I need you, Lord
  now more than anything.

Be my love forever.

I love you.

Amen.
