# Introduction

## What is this?

Once upon a time, my kids were curious about the books in my office, and asked, "Papa, what are all these books about." I told them, "Mostly, they all say the same thing--that Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so."

This is my humble attempt to be a part of books that say nothing but how much Jesus loves me.
