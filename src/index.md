## The Thought

>No pen, no words, no image can express to you the loveliness of my only, only Lord Jesus.  
>\- Samuel Rutherford

## The Introduction

Once upon a time, my kids were curious about the books in my office and asked, "Papa, what are all these books about?" I told them, "Mostly, they all say the same thing--that Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so."

Theologicus is my humble attempt to be a part of that same set of books.

>No pen, no words, no image...

I know that is absolutely true. I don't have enough time left to write all the words. Still, I must try. I must spend all my breaths and life writing all my words expressing Christ's love and beauty because I love him so much. He is my Lord and my God. I am my Beloved's, and he is mine forever.

Suppose the Bible is a love letter from God to me. In that case, then Theologicus is my love letter right back to the Christ who loved me and gave himself up for me (Galatians 2:20). This is my little way of telling my Christ, "When I finally see you, I will hold your face and kiss your face with a thousand kisses because you are so beautiful to me, and you have loved me the best."

## The Text

In essence, Theologicus--all of my completed works, sermons, commentaries, and study notes--is my exposition of Psalm 17:15.

>Psalm 17:15 (CSB) But I will see your face in righteousness; when I awake, I will be satisfied with your presence.

Corem Deo. I will live before the face of my God. And I know that one day, I will behold my God.
