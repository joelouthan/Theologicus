## The Text

>Psalm 17:15 (CSB) But I will see your face in righteousness; when I awake, I will be satisfied with your presence.

Corem Deo. I will live before the face of my God. And I know that one day, I will behold my God.
## The Introduction

Once upon a time, my kids were curious about the books in my office and asked, "Papa, what are all these books about?" I told them, "Mostly, they all say the same thing--that Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so." 

I once wrote that this site was "my humble attempt to be a part of that same set of books." The more I write, the less I care about being published and the more I care about writing about the sweetness and goodness of my Lord and Savior.

As a devotional and expositional commentary on Psalm 17:15, this website is my personal confession of faith.

>No pen, no words, no image can express to you the loveliness of my only, only Lord Jesus.  
>\- Samuel Rutherford

And this site will always be my confession of faith in the only begotten Son of God. The way I look at it, I don't have enough time left on this earth to write all the words about Jesus. Yet still, as I breathe air and live this life he has given me, I must at least try to write all the words. I must spend all my breath and life writing all the words that express Christ's love and beauty, because I love Him so much. He is my Lord and my God. I am my Beloved's, and he is mine forever.

Let us suppose the Bible is God's love letter to me. In that case, then Theologicus is my love letter right back to the Christ who loved me and gave himself up for me (Galatians 2:20). This is my little way of telling my Christ:

**When I finally see you, I will behold your face and kiss your face with a thousand kisses because you are so beautiful to me, and you have loved me the best.**

Amen.
