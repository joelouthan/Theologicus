## The Creed

>I believe in God, the Father Almighty,  
>the Creator of heaven and earth,  
>and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord:  
>Who was conceived of the Holy Spirit,  
>born of the Virgin Mary,  
>suffered under Pontius Pilate,  
>was crucified, died, and was buried.  
>He descended into hell.  
>  
>The third day He arose again from the dead.  
>He ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty,  
>whence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.  
>  
>I believe in the Holy Spirit,<bgy> **the holy catholic church** </bgy>,  
>the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins,  
>the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting.  
>  
>Amen.

## The Word

>Hebrews 12:23 (CSB) to the assembly of the firstborn whose names have been written in heaven, to a Judge, who is God of all, to the spirits of righteous people made perfect,

## The Belief

>The catholic or universal church, which (with respect to the internal work of the Spirit and truth of grace) may be called invisible, consists of the whole number of the elect, that have been, are, or shall be gathered into one, under Christ, the head thereof; and is the spouse, the body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.

### The Holy Catholic Church is invisible

>Hebrews 12:23 (CSB) to the assembly of the firstborn whose names have been written in heaven, to a Judge, who is God of all, to the spirits of righteous people made perfect,

### The Holy Catholic Church is headed by Christ--full stop

>Colossians 1:18 (CSB) He is also the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in everything.

### The Holy Catholic Church is the sermon preached to the angels, Satan and demons

>Ephesians 3:8-10 (CSB) This grace was given to me — the least of all the saints — to proclaim to the Gentiles the incalculable riches of Christ, and to shed light for all about the administration of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things. This is so that God’s multi-faceted wisdom may now be made known through the church to the rulers and authorities in the heavens.

### The Holy Catholic Church is the bride of Christ

>Ephesians 5:23–32 (CSB) because the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church. He is the Savior of the body. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives are to submit to their husbands in everything. Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself for her to make her holy, cleansing her with the washing of water by the word. He did this to present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or anything like that, but holy and blameless. In the same way, husbands are to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. For no one ever hates his own flesh but provides and cares for it, just as Christ does for the church, since we are members of his body. For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh. This mystery is profound, but I am talking about Christ and the church.

>Revelation 19:6-9 (CSB) Then I heard something like the voice of a vast multitude, like the sound of cascading waters, and like the rumbling of loud thunder, saying,  
>Hallelujah, because our Lord God, the Almighty,  
>reigns!  
>Let us be glad, rejoice, and give him glory,  
>because the marriage of the Lamb has come,  
>and his bride has prepared herself.  
>She was given fine linen to wear, bright and pure.  
>For the fine linen represents the righteous acts of the saints.  
>Then he said to me, “Write: Blessed are those invited to the marriage feast of the Lamb! ” He also said to me, “These words of God are true.”

>Revelation 21:9-11 (CSB) Then one of the seven angels, who had held the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues, came and spoke with me: “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.” He then carried me away in the Spirit to a great, high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, arrayed with God’s glory. Her radiance was like a precious jewel, like a jasper stone, clear as crystal.

>Revelation 22:16-17 (CSB) “I, Jesus, have sent my angel to attest these things to you for the churches. I am the Root and descendant of David, the bright morning star.” Both the Spirit and the bride say, “Come! ” Let anyone who hears, say, “Come! ” Let the one who is thirsty come. Let the one who desires take the water of life freely.
