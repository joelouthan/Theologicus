# Luke 6:24-26 The Lord Gives Consequences For Our Sins

<!-- toc -->

## The Lord Blesses The Poor

>Luke 6:20 (CSB) Then looking up at his disciples, he said:  
>Blessed are you who are poor,  
>because the kingdom of God is yours.

What do you think Christ meant by poor?

>Luke 17:5–6 (CSB) The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith.”“If you have faith the size of a mustard seed,” the Lord said, “you can say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it will obey you.

>Galatians 2:20 (CSB) I have been crucified with Christ, and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.

If we have just a little faith, will we still receive God? Do we still get God?

## The Lord Blesses The Hungry

>Luke 6:21a (CSB)  
>Blessed are you who are hungry now,  
>because you will be filled.

>Psalm 42:1 (CSB)  
>As a deer longs for flowing streams,  
>so I long for you, God.

>Revelation 7:15–17 (CSB)  
>For this reason they are before the throne of God,  
>and they serve him day and night in his temple.  
>The one seated on the throne will shelter them:  
>They will no longer hunger;  
>they will no longer thirst;  
>the sun will no longer strike them,  
>nor will any scorching heat.  
>For the Lamb who is at the center of the throne  
>will shepherd them;  
>he will guide them to springs of the waters of life,  
>and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.

>Psalm 17:15 (CSB) But I will see your face in righteousness; when I awake, I will be satisfied with your presence.

Can you imagine never being hungry or thirst again?

Can you imagine never feeling pain or never being hurt again?

Can you imagine never being sad or lonely again?

>Ecclesiastes 3:11 (CSB) He has made everything appropriate in its time. He has also put eternity in their hearts, but no one can discover the work God has done from beginning to end.

Who can fill the loneliness, anger, bitterness, emptiness within our hearts?

What does God need to do with our hearts before He can step into it?

## The Lord Blesses Those Who Weep

>Luke 6:21b (CSB)  
>Blessed are you who weep now,  
>because you will laugh.

>Romans 12:15 (CSB) Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep.

What is comfort? What is like to be comforted?

How can we mourn over things that make us feel sad?

## The Lord Blesses The Hated

>Luke 6:22-23 (CSB)  
>Blessed are you when people hate you,  
>when they exclude you, insult you,  
>and slander your name as evil  
>because of the Son of Man.
>
>“Rejoice in that day and leap for joy. Take note—your reward is great in heaven, for this is the way their ancestors used to treat the prophets.

>Romans 12:14 (CSB) Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.
