# Luke: A Few Resources

## It Goes Without Say

Many times, many teachers, preachers, and small group leaders (myself included) will "cut straight to the chase" and engage the commentary instead of engaging the Word of God. Remember, the commentaries are not without error—they are the observations of the author.

Slow down, pray, read, chew and meditate.

Note: I use the [Christian Standard Bible](https://csbible.com) version on this blog default. Other translations, such as the [ESV](https://www.crossway.org/bibles/) or the [NIV1984](https://bibleportal.com/version/NIV1984), will be noted as such.

Incredible resource. I have purchased this resource multiple times over for myself and friends. If you want one and can't afford one, hit me up.

## Commentaries & Books

This is fresh off the presses. I have read [Romans, John, Mark, Acts, 1 & 2 Peter, and Matthew](https://amzn.to/3jc5I02) from this set. I can easily recommend every single one of them.

If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Keep on truckin'.

Do I know anything about this guy? Nope. A few Amazon reviewers thought he was super solid and a conservative theologian.

When I started up this series, I was hard up for good Luke resources. God's pure grace and timing, this fell into my lap.  So I am going out with the horse I rode in on and keeping this as part of the stack.

I swear to beans I have more books from this guy. But a quick look-see on Amazon shows that he is a one-lane kind-of-guy. He knows his Luke-Acts. (Now that I think about it, I am getting him mixed up with *Daniel I. Block* who wrote [Ezekiel (NICOT)](https://amzn.to/3azIXiq).)

So, I got the first three volumes released back a few years ago. Now they are up to 11 volumes. Also, I just created a budget that allows me to purchase one commentary per paycheck. (Bivocational is the providence of God.)

The authors are top notch. This will be referenced for sure.
