## Versioning

Semantic Versioning will be as following:

### MAJOR 1.x.x

New technology. In other words, as long as I using [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook), Theologicus will remain in version 3.x.x.

### MINOR 1.1.x

New **finished** exposition series. When the series is complete, this will bump up version from 3.0 to 3.1, for example.

### PATCH 1.1.1

New sermons or new articles. This will go from 3.0.0 to 3.0.1 to 3.0.2 and so on.
