# Lecture 15: What is Preaching, Part 2

Hitting the target of what is preaching

## What is Preaching: Exaltational

Make much of God.

"Pastor, what a great God we have!" - greatest compliment to your preaching

>>Every great preacher of God is a preacher of a great God. SLJ

Is there a lot of God in you preaching?

</bgy>Exercise</bgy>: Examine Peter's sermon on the day of Pentecost in Acts 2:14-41 and highlight every time Peter mentions God.

>Acts 2:14–41  
><sup>14</sup> Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice, and proclaimed to them, “Fellow Jews and all you residents of Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and pay attention to my words. 

><sup>15</sup> For these people are not drunk, as you suppose, since it’s only nine in the morning. 

><sup>16</sup> On the contrary, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel: 

><sup>17</sup> And it will be in the last days, says <bgy>God</bgy>, that I will pour out my <bgy>Spirit</bgy> on all people; then your sons and your daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams. 

><sup>18</sup> I will even pour out my <bgy>Spirit</bgy> on my servants in those days, both men and women and they will prophesy. 

><sup>19</sup> I will display wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth below: blood and fire and a cloud of smoke. 

><sup>20</sup> The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the great and glorious day of the <bgy>Lord</bgy> comes. 

><sup>21</sup> Then everyone who calls on the name of the <bgy>Lord</bgy> will be saved. 

><sup>22</sup> “Fellow Israelites, listen to these words: This <bgy>Jesus</bgy> of Nazareth was a man attested to you by <bgy>God</bgy> with miracles, wonders, and signs that <bgy>God</bgy> did among you through <bgy>him</bgy>, just as you yourselves know. 

><sup>23</sup> Though <bgy>he</bgy> was delivered up according to <bgy>God’s</bgy> determined plan and foreknowledge, you used lawless people to nail <bgy>him</bgy> to a cross and kill <bgy>him</bgy>. 

><sup>24</sup> <bgy>God</bgy> raised <bgy>him</bgy> up, ending the pains of death, because it was not possible for <bgy>him</bgy> to be held by death. 

><sup>25</sup> For David says of <bgy>him</bgy>: I saw the <bgy>Lord</bgy> ever before me; because <bgy>he</bgy> is at my right hand, I will not be shaken. 

><sup>26</sup> Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices. Moreover, my flesh will rest in hope, 

><sup>27</sup> because <bgy>you</bgy> will not abandon <bgy>me</bgy> in Hades or allow your <bgy>holy one</bgy> to see decay. 

><sup>28</sup> <bgy>You</bgy> have revealed the paths of life to me; <bgy>you</bgy> will fill me with gladness in <bgy>your</bgy> presence. 

><sup>29</sup> “Brothers and sisters, I can confidently speak to you about the patriarch David: He is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. 

><sup>30</sup> Since he was a prophet, he knew that <bgy>God</bgy> had sworn an oath to him to seat one of his descendants on his throne. 

><sup>31</sup> Seeing what was to come, he spoke concerning the resurrection of the <bgy>Messiah</bgy>: <bgy>He</bgy> was not abandoned in Hades, and <bgy>his</bgy> flesh did not experience decay. 

><sup>32</sup> “</bgy>God</bgy> has raised this <bgy>Jesus</bgy>; we are all witnesses of this. 

><sup>33</sup> Therefore, since he has been exalted to the right hand of <bgy>God</bgy> and has received from the <bgy>Father</bgy> the promised <bgy>Holy</bgy> <bgy>Spirit</bgy>, he has poured out what you both see and hear. 

><sup>34</sup> For it was not David who ascended into the heavens, but he himself says: The <bgy>Lord</bgy> declared to my <bgy>Lord</bgy>, ‘Sit at my right hand 

><sup>35</sup> until I make your enemies your footstool.’ 

><sup>36</sup> “Therefore let all the house of Israel know with certainty that <bgy>God</bgy> has made this <bgy>Jesus</bgy>, whom you crucified, both <bgy>Lord</bgy> and <bgy>Messiah</bgy>.” 

><sup>37</sup> When they heard this, they were pierced to the heart and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what should we do?” 

><sup>38</sup> Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, each of you, in the name of <bgy>Jesus</bgy> <bgy>Christ</bgy> for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the <bgy>Holy</bgy> <bgy>Spirit</bgy>. 

><sup>39</sup> For the promise is for you and for your children, and for all who are far off, as many as the <bgy>Lord</bgy> our <bgy>God</bgy> will call.” 

><sup>40</sup> With many other words he testified and strongly urged them, saying, “Be saved from this corrupt generation!” 

><sup>41</sup> So those who accepted his message were baptized, and that day about three thousand people were added to them.

This is what your preaching should look like. Not your opinions, ideas, hot takes, quips, culture observations, what you watched on TV the other night. The weight, the bulk, the heaviness, the awe, the amount, the heaviest lifting in your sermons needs to be about God and God alone!

>You may not have the biggest nor the largest church in town, but you can preach the biggest God.

Are you a big God preacher?

Piper preaching on Isaiah 6--no application. Just God!

## What is Preaching: Experiential

Begins with teaching--but goes deeper to the heart, soul, spirit, and the will. Must lead to a real life experience with God and behold the face of God!

In other words, you must address the whole person.

Do your people know the truth or do they *love* the truth?

Doctrine -> Duty

Romans 1-11 -> Romans 12-16  
Ephesians 1-3 -> Ephesians 4-6

First, we teach. Then we preach. Instruct then exhortation.

## What is Preaching: Earnest

Serious. Reverence. Awe. Comes from a man who fears God. Growing in the fear of God.

Never outgrow but grow in the fear of God. NASB: *Solemnly testifying*

>2 Corinthians 6:2–10  
><sup>2</sup> For he says: At an acceptable time I listened to you, and in the day of salvation I helped you. See, now is the acceptable time; now is the day of salvation! 
>
><sup>3</sup> We are not giving anyone an occasion for offense, so that the ministry will not be blamed. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Instead, as God’s ministers, we commend ourselves in everything: by great endurance, by afflictions, by hardships, by difficulties, 
>
><sup>5</sup> by beatings, by imprisonments, by riots, by labors, by sleepless nights, by times of hunger, 
>
><sup>6</sup> by purity, by knowledge, by patience, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by sincere love, 
>
><sup>7</sup> by the word of truth, by the power of God; through weapons of righteousness for the right hand and the left, 
>
><sup>8</sup> through glory and dishonor, through slander and good report; regarded as deceivers, yet true; 
>
><sup>9</sup> as unknown, yet recognized; as dying, yet see—we live; as being disciplined, yet not killed; 
>
><sup>10</sup> as grieving, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet enriching many; as having nothing, yet possessing everything.

OT: Prophets carried the burden of the Lord.

Preach in the presence of God.

Preach as if you are preaching to God.

Preach to get your Amen from God.

Preach in the face of God.
