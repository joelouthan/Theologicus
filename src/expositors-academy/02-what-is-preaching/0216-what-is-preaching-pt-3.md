# Lecture 16: What is Preaching, Part III

## What is Preaching: Emphatic

Not wishy-washy. Definitive. Sure. Not: "It seems to me..."

>Matthew 7:28–29 (CSB) When Jesus had finished saying these things, **the crowds were astonished at his teaching, because he was teaching them like one who had authority, and not like their scribes**.

>Matthew 5:21 (CSB) “**You have heard that it was said to our ancestors**, Do not murder, and whoever murders will be subject to judgment.

>Matthew 5:28 (CSB) **But I tell you**, everyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

>Titus 2:15 (CSB) Proclaim these things; encourage and rebuke with all authority. Let no one disregard you.

Must be open to correction. Not infallible. But you have to sure as snot.

>2 Corinthians 4:13 (CSB) And since we have the same spirit of faith in keeping with what is written, **I believed, therefore I spoke, we also believe, and therefore speak**.

We speak what we believe. Firmest convictions.

>1 Thessalonians 1:4-10 (CSB) For we know, brothers and sisters loved by God, that he has chosen you, **because our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power, in the Holy Spirit, and with full assurance**. You know how we lived among you for your benefit, and you yourselves became imitators of us and of the Lord when, in spite of severe persecution, you welcomed the message with joy from the Holy Spirit. As a result, you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia. For the word of the Lord rang out from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place that your faith in God has gone out. Therefore, we don’t need to say anything, for they themselves report what kind of reception we had from you: how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead — Jesus, who rescues us from the coming wrath.

Full assurance resides in the heart of the preacher in the power of the Holy Spirit.

Full conviction = full assurance

Erasumus to Luther: You cannot be convicted. You cannot be this sure.

Luther to Erasumus: To be unsure is not the mark of the Christian.

We have assertions.

>1 Corinthians 15:1–4 (CSB) Now I want to make clear for you, brothers and sisters, the gospel I preached to you, which you received, on which you have taken your stand and by which you are being saved, if you hold to the message I preached to you—unless you believed in vain. For I passed on to you as most important what I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,

## What is Preaching: Empathetic

Not to bully and intimate. But deep compassion. Truth with love.

It has been said, "People do not care how much you know until they know how much you care."

>Matthew 9:36 (CSB) When he saw the crowds, he felt compassion for them, because they were distressed and dejected, like sheep without a shepherd.

Compassion - bowels. The deepest part of you. The seat of your emotions.

>Matthew 14:14 (CSB) When he went ashore, he saw a large crowd, had compassion on them, and healed their sick.

*I love you with all of my guts*

>Matthew 15:32 (CSB) Jesus called his disciples and said, “I have compassion on the crowd, because they’ve already stayed with me three days and have nothing to eat. I don’t want to send them away hungry, otherwise they might collapse on the way.”

>Matthew 20:34 (CSB) Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes. Immediately they could see, and they followed him.

Weep with those who weep. Rejoice with those who rejoice.

>1 Corinthians 13:1–2 (CSB) If I speak human or angelic tongues but do not have love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so that I can move mountains but do not have love, I am nothing.

Nothing but hot air. There must be love. Fruit of the Spirit.
