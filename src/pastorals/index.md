# The Pastoral Epistles: An Introduction & Recommendations

## The Introduction

This series was born out of two things: a desire to serve my local church as an elder and a conversation with my mentor.

I was saved by Christ in April of 2007. Six months later, I wanted to preach the gospel of Christ every day and twice on Sunday. And since then, I have wrestled with that unction. I can preach anywhere but I had serious convictions to do so only as an ordained minister to the local church. What does it mean to be ordained? There are qualifications. And despite the numerous church and denominations, I turned to the Pastoral Epistles to see what the Bible says about the qualifications of an elder and if I fit that qualification.

And then, just have breakfast with a mentor, he suggested journaling my thoughts on the Pastoral Epistles. These are those thoughts.

## It Goes Without Say

Many times, many teachers, preachers, and small group leaders (myself included) will "cut straight to the chase" and engage the commentary instead of engaging the Word of God. Remember, the commentaries are not without error—they are the observations of the author.

Slow down, pray, read, chew and meditate.

Note: I use the [Christian Standard Bible](https://csbible.com) version on this blog default. Other translations, such as the [ESV](https://www.crossway.org/bibles/) or the [NIV1984](https://bibleportal.com/version/NIV1984), will be noted as such.

I don't have much to say except this: if I was restricted to one Study Bible, this would be the one. Even if they never make one for the CSB. That is how much I love R.C. Sproul's notes--they will always refer back to historical creeds and confessions.
