# 1 Samuel: An Introduction & Resources

## The Introduction

>Psalm 16 (CSB) A Miktam of David.
>
><sup>1</sup> Protect me, God, for I take refuge in you. 
>
><sup>2</sup> I said to the LORD, “You are my Lord; I have nothing good besides you.” 
>
><sup>3</sup> As for the holy people who are in the land, they are the noble ones. All my delight is in them. 
>
><sup>4</sup> The sorrows of those who take another god for themselves will multiply; I will not pour out their drink offerings of blood, and I will not speak their names with my lips. 
>
><sup>5</sup> LORD, you are my portion and my cup of blessing; you hold my future. 
>
><sup>6</sup> The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; indeed, I have a beautiful inheritance. 
>
><sup>7</sup> I will bless the LORD who counsels me— even at night when my thoughts trouble me. 
>
><sup>8</sup> I always let the LORD guide me. Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken. 
>
><sup>9</sup> Therefore my heart is glad and my whole being rejoices; my body also rests securely. 
>
><sup>10</sup> For you will not abandon me to Sheol; you will not allow your faithful one to see decay. 
>
><sup>11</sup> You reveal the path of life to me; in your presence is abundant joy; at your right hand are eternal pleasures.

Finishing our first series, [Apostles' Creed](https://theologic.us/creed-apostles/index.html), in the Bible Study with my son, [Yusef](https://www.instagram.com/big_yuzi/), he asked if we could do a study on the life of David.

The only thing I can say is, "There's nothing to it but to do it."
