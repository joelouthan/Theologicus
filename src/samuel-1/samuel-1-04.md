# 1 Samuel 4 The Execution of God's Anointed

## The Word

>John 3:36 (CSB) The one who believes in the Son has eternal life, but the one who rejects the Son will not see life; instead, the wrath of God remains on him.

## The Passage

>1 Samuel 4 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> And Samuel’s words came to all Israel. Israel went out to meet the Philistines in battle and camped at Ebenezer while the Philistines camped at Aphek. 
>
><sup>2</sup> The Philistines lined up in battle formation against Israel, and as the battle intensified, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who struck down about four thousand men on the battlefield. 
>
><sup>3</sup> When the troops returned to the camp, the elders of Israel asked, “Why did the LORD defeat us today before the Philistines? Let’s bring the ark of the LORD’s covenant from Shiloh. Then it will go with us and save us from our enemies.” 
>
><sup>4</sup> So the people sent men to Shiloh to bring back the ark of the covenant of the LORD of Armies, who is enthroned between the cherubim. Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God. 
>
><sup>5</sup> When the ark of the covenant of the LORD entered the camp, all the Israelites raised such a loud shout that the ground shook. 
>
><sup>6</sup> The Philistines heard the sound of the war cry and asked, “What’s this loud shout in the Hebrews’ camp?” When the Philistines discovered that the ark of the LORD had entered the camp, 
>
><sup>7</sup> they panicked. “A god has entered their camp!” they said. “Woe to us! Nothing like this has happened before. 
>
><sup>8</sup> Woe to us! Who will rescue us from these magnificent gods? These are the gods that slaughtered the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness. 
>
><sup>9</sup> Show some courage and be men, Philistines! Otherwise, you’ll serve the Hebrews just as they served you. Now be men and fight!” 
>
><sup>10</sup> So the Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and each man fled to his tent. The slaughter was severe—thirty thousand of the Israelite foot soldiers fell. 
>
><sup>11</sup> The ark of God was captured, and Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died. 
>
><sup>12</sup> That same day, a Benjaminite man ran from the battle and came to Shiloh. His clothes were torn, and there was dirt on his head. 
>
><sup>13</sup> When he arrived, there was Eli sitting on his chair beside the road waiting, because he was anxious about the ark of God. When the man entered the city to give a report, the entire city cried out. 
>
><sup>14</sup> Eli heard the outcry and asked, “Why this commotion?” The man quickly came and reported to Eli. 
>
><sup>15</sup> At that time Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes didn’t move because he couldn’t see. 
>
><sup>16</sup> The man said to Eli, “I’m the one who came from the battle. I fled from there today.” “What happened, my son?” Eli asked. 
>
><sup>17</sup> The messenger answered, “Israel has fled from the Philistines, and also there was a great slaughter among the people. Your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are both dead, and the ark of God has been captured.” 
>
><sup>18</sup> When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell backward off the chair by the city gate, and since he was old and heavy, his neck broke and he died. Eli had judged Israel forty years. 
>
><sup>19</sup> Eli’s daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and about to give birth. When she heard the news about the capture of God’s ark and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband, she collapsed and gave birth because her labor pains came on her. 
>
><sup>20</sup> As she was dying, the women taking care of her said, “Don’t be afraid. You’ve given birth to a son!” But she did not respond or pay attention. 
>
><sup>21</sup> She named the boy Ichabod, saying, “The glory has departed from Israel,” referring to the capture of the ark of God and to the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband. 
>
><sup>22</sup> “The glory has departed from Israel,” she said, “because the ark of God has been captured.”

### The Execution of God: Our Lives Are In His Hands

>Job 14:5 (CSB) Since a person’s days are determined
and the number of his months depends on you,
and since you have set limits he cannot pass,

>Psalms 39:4-5 (CSB) “LORD, make me aware of my end  
and the number of my days  
so that I will know how short-lived I am.  
In fact, you have made my days just inches long,  
and my life span is as nothing to you.  
Yes, every human being stands as only a vapor. Selah

### The Execution of God: We Cannot Manipulate God

>Philippians 2:12-13 (CSB) Therefore, my dear friends, just as you have always obeyed, so now, not only in my presence but even more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God who is working in you both to will and to work according to his good purpose.

We cannot thwart the will of the Almighty God.

Yet, the church is flirting with the notion that we can somehow coerce or manipulate God into doing our will. Like "if you do the right things, God will bless you." Or as if if you do the right things, God somehow owes you something.

>Romans 4:2-5 (CSB) If Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about — but not before God. For what does the Scripture say? Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness. Now to the one who works, pay is not credited as a gift, but as something owed. But to the one who does not work, but believes on him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited for righteousness.

In a way, this is the gospel. God Almighty demands sheer perfection--that our good deeds (declared good by him alone) must be done with the absolute perfect motive. And that is where we fall short. We cannot do anything that would please him. We half-hearted do a bunch of good things like not-sin and then we sit around and act like, "Okay, God, give me what I want. Where are you?" God is in the heavens and ruling over all creation. He does everything for his glory and good pleasure.

Here's the thing. He looked upon us, saw that the intentions of our minds and hearts were continuously evil. What does God the Father ends up doing for us wicked and perverted people?

He gave us everything!

How do I know this? Because he gave his only begotten Son, Jesus Christ! And to seal the deal once and for all, he gave his Holy Spirit!

>John 3:16 (CSB) For God loved the world in this way: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.

>Ephesians 1:7-10 (CSB) In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace that he richly poured out on us with all wisdom and understanding. He made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure that he purposed in Christ as a plan for the right time — to bring everything together in Christ, both things in heaven and things on earth in him.

Who is like our God and who dares to compare to him?

Whatever you and I have in this life--a little or a lot-- we have it all because we have the Christ!

Who can stand against us? We have the Christ!

Who can condemn us? We have the Christ!

Who can separate us from the love of God? We have the Christ!

>Philippians 4:19 (CSB) And my God will supply all your needs according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.

>In Christ, you have given me so much that heaven can give me no more.

### The Execution of God: God Raises Kings and God Removes Kings

The books of Samuel are to declare one thing. Judges may come and go. Prophets may come and go. Priests and Kings may come and go but Christ is our Prophet, Priest, and King forever. By his perfect life, death, and resurrection, he will come again to judge the living and dead. And Jesus Christ alone is the same yesterday, today, and forever.

### The Execution of God: We Are Not Of The World

>John 17:14-16 (CSB) I have given them your word. The world hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. I am not praying that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one. They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.

>Romans 8:17 (CSB) and if children, also heirs — heirs of God and coheirs with Christ — if indeed we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.

We are co-heirs with the Son who is heir of all things.

We have it all. We have his glory. But we also have his sufferings. 

And yet, we have his blessed assurance that the Father and the Son will never let us go and we are in the family of God the Father forever and ever.

Sin has broken this world and our hearts, souls and mind. But Christ was given to us to make all things new.

Who can stand against us? We have the Christ.

>
><sup>5</sup> They have mouths but cannot speak, eyes, but cannot see. 
>
><sup>6</sup> They have ears but cannot hear, noses, but cannot smell. 
>
