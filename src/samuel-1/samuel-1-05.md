# 1 Samuel 5 There Are No Other Gods

## The Word

>Isaiah 45:4-7 (CSB) I call you by your name,  
>for the sake of my servant Jacob  
>and Israel my chosen one.  
>I give a name to you,  
>though you do not know me.  
>I am the LORD, and there is no other;  
><bgy>there is no God but me.</bgy>  
>I will strengthen you,  
>though you do not know me,  
>so that all may know from the rising of the sun to its setting  
>that there is no one but me.  
>I am the LORD, and there is no other.  
>I form light and create darkness,  
>I make success and create disaster;  
>I am the LORD, who does all these things.

## The Passage

>1 Samuel 5 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> After the Philistines had captured the ark of God, they took it from Ebenezer to Ashdod, 
>
><sup>2</sup> brought it into the temple of Dagon and placed it next to his statue. 
>
><sup>3</sup> When the people of Ashdod got up early the next morning, there was Dagon, fallen with his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD. So they took Dagon and returned him to his place. 
>
><sup>4</sup> But when they got up early the next morning, there was Dagon, fallen with his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD. This time, Dagon’s head and both of his hands were broken off and lying on the threshold. Only Dagon’s torso remained. 
>
><sup>5</sup> That is why, still today, the priests of Dagon and everyone who enters the temple of Dagon in Ashdod do not step on Dagon’s threshold. 
>
><sup>6</sup> The LORD’s hand was heavy on the people of Ashdod. He terrified the people of Ashdod and its territory and afflicted them with tumors. 
>
><sup>7</sup> When the people of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, “The ark of Israel’s God must not stay here with us, because his hand is strongly against us and our god Dagon.” 
>
><sup>8</sup> So they called all the Philistine rulers together and asked, “What should we do with the ark of Israel’s God?” “The ark of Israel’s God should be moved to Gath,” they replied. So they moved the ark of Israel’s God. 
>
><sup>9</sup> After they had moved it, the LORD’s hand was against the city of Gath, causing a great panic. He afflicted the people of the city, from the youngest to the oldest, with an outbreak of tumors. 
>
><sup>10</sup> The people of Gath then sent the ark of God to Ekron, but when it got there, the Ekronites cried out, “They’ve moved the ark of Israel’s God to us to kill us and our people!” 
>
><sup>11</sup> The Ekronites called all the Philistine rulers together. They said, “Send the ark of Israel’s God away. Let it return to its place so it won’t kill us and our people!” For the fear of death pervaded the city; God’s hand was oppressing them. 
>
><sup>12</sup> Those who did not die were afflicted with tumors, and the outcry of the city went up to heaven.

When he saw Jesus, he cried out, fell down before him, and said in a loud voice, “What do you have to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torment me! ” For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was guarded, bound by chains and shackles, he would snap the restraints and be driven by the demon into deserted places.
>“What is your name? ” Jesus asked him.
>“Legion,” he said, because many demons had entered him. And they begged him not to banish them to the abyss.
