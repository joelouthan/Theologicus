## The Word

><bgy>there is no God but me.</bgy>  
>I will strengthen you,

## The Passage

>1 Samuel 5 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> After the Philistines had captured the ark of God, they took it from Ebenezer to Ashdod, 
>
><sup>2</sup> brought it into the temple of Dagon and placed it next to his statue. 
>
><sup>3</sup> When the people of Ashdod got up early the next morning, there was Dagon, fallen with his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD. So they took Dagon and returned him to his place. 
>
><sup>4</sup> But when they got up early the next morning, there was Dagon, fallen with his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD. This time, Dagon’s head and both of his hands were broken off and lying on the threshold. Only Dagon’s torso remained. 
>
><sup>5</sup> That is why, still today, the priests of Dagon and everyone who enters the temple of Dagon in Ashdod do not step on Dagon’s threshold. 
>
><sup>6</sup> The LORD’s hand was heavy on the people of Ashdod. He terrified the people of Ashdod and its territory and afflicted them with tumors. 
>
><sup>7</sup> When the people of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, “The ark of Israel’s God must not stay here with us, because his hand is strongly against us and our god Dagon.” 
>
><sup>8</sup> So they called all the Philistine rulers together and asked, “What should we do with the ark of Israel’s God?” “The ark of Israel’s God should be moved to Gath,” they replied. So they moved the ark of Israel’s God. 
>
><sup>9</sup> After they had moved it, the LORD’s hand was against the city of Gath, causing a great panic. He afflicted the people of the city, from the youngest to the oldest, with an outbreak of tumors. 
>
><sup>10</sup> The people of Gath then sent the ark of God to Ekron, but when it got there, the Ekronites cried out, “They’ve moved the ark of Israel’s God to us to kill us and our people!” 
>
><sup>11</sup> The Ekronites called all the Philistine rulers together. They said, “Send the ark of Israel’s God away. Let it return to its place so it won’t kill us and our people!” For the fear of death pervaded the city; God’s hand was oppressing them. 
>
><sup>12</sup> Those who did not die were afflicted with tumors, and the outcry of the city went up to heaven.

## The Song

>Isaiah 42:5–9 (CSB)  
><sup>5</sup> This is what God, the LORD, says— who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread out the earth and what comes from it, who gives breath to the people on it and spirit to those who walk on it— 
>
><sup>6</sup> “I am the LORD. I have called you for a righteous purpose, and I will hold you by your hand. I will watch over you, and I will appoint you to be a covenant for the people and a light to the nations, 
>
><sup>7</sup> in order to open blind eyes, to bring out prisoners from the dungeon, and those sitting in darkness from the prison house. 
>
><sup>8</sup> I am the LORD. That is my name, and I will not give my glory to another or my praise to idols. 
>
><sup>9</sup> The past events have indeed happened. Now I declare new events; I announce them to you before they occur.”
