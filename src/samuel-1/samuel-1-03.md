# 1 Samuel 3 The Calling of God's Anointed

## The Word

>John 11:43 (CSB) After he said this, he shouted with a loud voice, “**Lazarus, come out!** ”

## The Study

>1 Samuel 3 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> The boy Samuel served the LORD in Eli’s presence. In those days the word of the LORD was rare and prophetic visions were not widespread. 
>
><sup>2</sup> One day Eli, whose eyesight was failing, was lying in his usual place. 
>
><sup>3</sup> Before the lamp of God had gone out, Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was located. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Then the LORD called Samuel, and he answered, “Here I am.” 
>
><sup>5</sup> He ran to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.” “I didn’t call,” Eli replied. “Go back and lie down.” So he went and lay down. 
>
><sup>6</sup> Once again the LORD called, “Samuel!” Samuel got up, went to Eli, and said, “Here I am; you called me.” “I didn’t call, my son,” he replied. “Go back and lie down.” 
>
><sup>7</sup> Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, because the word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him. 
>
><sup>8</sup> Once again, for the third time, the LORD called Samuel. He got up, went to Eli, and said, “Here I am; you called me.” Then Eli understood that the LORD was calling the boy. 
>
><sup>9</sup> He told Samuel, “Go and lie down. If he calls you, say, ‘Speak, LORD, for your servant is listening.’ ” So Samuel went and lay down in his place. 
>
><sup>10</sup> The LORD came, stood there, and called as before, “Samuel, Samuel!” Samuel responded, “Speak, for your servant is listening.” 
>
><sup>11</sup> The LORD said to Samuel, “I am about to do something in Israel that will cause everyone who hears about it to shudder. 
>
><sup>12</sup> On that day I will carry out against Eli everything I said about his family, from beginning to end. 
>
><sup>13</sup> I told him that I am going to judge his family forever because of the iniquity he knows about: his sons are cursing God, and he has not stopped them. 
>
><sup>14</sup> Therefore, I have sworn to Eli’s family: The iniquity of Eli’s family will never be wiped out by either sacrifice or offering.” 
>
><sup>15</sup> Samuel lay down until the morning; then he opened the doors of the LORD’s house. He was afraid to tell Eli the vision, 
>
><sup>16</sup> but Eli called him and said, “Samuel, my son.” “Here I am,” answered Samuel. 
>
><sup>17</sup> “What was the message he gave you?” Eli asked. “Don’t hide it from me. May God punish you and do so severely if you hide anything from me that he told you.” 
>
><sup>18</sup> So Samuel told him everything and did not hide anything from him. Eli responded, “He is the LORD. Let him do what he thinks is good.” 
>
><sup>19</sup> Samuel grew. The LORD was with him, and he fulfilled everything Samuel prophesied. 
>
><sup>20</sup> All Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was a confirmed prophet of the LORD. 
>
><sup>21</sup> The LORD continued to appear in Shiloh, because there he revealed himself to Samuel by his word.

>1 Samuel 3:1–5 (CSB) The boy Samuel served the LORD in Eli’s presence. In those days the word of the LORD was rare and prophetic visions were not widespread. One day Eli, whose eyesight was failing, was lying in his usual place. Before the lamp of God had gone out, Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was located. Then the LORD called Samuel, and he answered, “Here I am.” He ran to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.” “I didn’t call,” Eli replied. “Go back and lie down.” So he went and lay down.

### The Calling of God: God calls upon us

>John 3:8 (CSB) The wind blows where it pleases, and you hear its sound, but you don’t know where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.”

---

><sup>6</sup> Once again the LORD called, “Samuel!” Samuel got up, went to Eli, and said, “Here I am; you called me.” “I didn’t call, my son,” he replied. “Go back and lie down.” 

### The Calling of God: God knows us intimately

>Matthew 10:29–31 (CSB) Aren’t two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them falls to the ground without your Father’s consent. But even the hairs of your head have all been counted. So don’t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.

>Psalm 139:1–6 (CSB) LORD, you have searched me and known me. You know when I sit down and when I stand up; you understand my thoughts from far away. You observe my travels and my rest; you are aware of all my ways. Before a word is on my tongue, you know all about it, LORD. You have encircled me; you have placed your hand on me. This wondrous knowledge is beyond me. It is lofty; I am unable to reach it.

>Romans 5:8 (CSB) But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

---

><sup>7</sup> Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, because the word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him. 

### The Calling of God: God reveals his word to us

>Matthew 4:4 (CSB) He answered, “It is written: Man must not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.”

>Romans 10:14-15 (CSB) How, then, can they call on him they have not believed in? And how can they believe without hearing about him? And how can they hear without a preacher? And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news.

><sup>8</sup> Once again, for the third time, the LORD called Samuel. He got up, went to Eli, and said, “Here I am; you called me.” Then Eli understood that the LORD was calling the boy. 
>
><sup>9</sup> He told Samuel, “Go and lie down. If he calls you, say, ‘Speak, LORD, for your servant is listening.’ ” So Samuel went and lay down in his place. 

### The Calling of God: God dwells in us so that we might hear his voice

>Ezekiel 36:24–28 (CSB) “ ‘For I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries, and will bring you into your own land. I will also sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your impurities and all your idols. I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will remove your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. I will place my Spirit within you and cause you to follow my statutes and carefully observe my ordinances. You will live in the land that I gave your ancestors; you will be my people, and I will be your God.

>John 14:16–17 (CSB) And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever. He is the Spirit of truth. The world is unable to receive him because it doesn’t see him or know him. But you do know him, because he remains with you and will be in you.

>Mark 7:31–37 (CSB) Again, leaving the region of Tyre, he went by way of Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, through the region of the Decapolis. They brought to him a deaf man who had difficulty speaking and begged Jesus to lay his hand on him. So he took him away from the crowd in private. After putting his fingers in the man’s ears and spitting, he touched his tongue. Looking up to heaven, he sighed deeply and said to him, “Ephphatha!” (that is, “Be opened!”). Immediately his ears were opened, his tongue was loosened, and he began to speak clearly. He ordered them to tell no one, but the more he ordered them, the more they proclaimed it. They were extremely astonished and said, “He has done everything well. He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.”

---

><sup>10</sup> The LORD came, stood there, and called as before, “Samuel, Samuel!” Samuel responded, “Speak, for your servant is listening.” 

### The Calling of God: We Get to Call Upon Him

>Psalm 50:15 (CSB) Call on me in a day of trouble; I will rescue you, and you will honor me.”

>Psalm 91:15 (CSB) When he calls out to me, I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble. I will rescue him and give him honor.

>Matthew 7:7–8 (CSB) “Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.

---

><sup>11</sup> The LORD said to Samuel, “I am about to do something in Israel that will cause everyone who hears about it to shudder. 
>
><sup>12</sup> On that day I will carry out against Eli everything I said about his family, from beginning to end. 
>
><sup>13</sup> I told him that I am going to judge his family forever because of the iniquity he knows about: his sons are cursing God, and he has not stopped them. 
>
><sup>14</sup> Therefore, I have sworn to Eli’s family: The iniquity of Eli’s family will never be wiped out by either sacrifice or offering.” 

### The Calling of God: God is slow

>2 Peter 3:8–9 (CSB) Dear friends, don’t overlook this one fact: With the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day. The Lord does not delay his promise, as some understand delay, but is patient with you, not wanting any to perish but all to come to repentance.

>Psalm 86:15 (CSB) But you, Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger and abounding in faithful love and truth.

>Exodus 34:6 (CSB) The LORD passed in front of him and proclaimed: The LORD—the LORD is a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger and abounding in faithful love and truth,

>Psalm 103:8-14 (CSB) The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in faithful love. He will not always accuse us or be angry forever. He has not dealt with us as our sins deserve or repaid us according to our iniquities. For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his faithful love toward those who fear him. As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us. As a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those who fear him. For he knows what we are made of, remembering that we are dust.

>Romans 2:4 (CSB) Or do you despise the riches of his kindness, restraint, and patience, not recognizing that God’s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?

---

><sup>15</sup> Samuel lay down until the morning; then he opened the doors of the LORD’s house. He was afraid to tell Eli the vision, 
>
><sup>16</sup> but Eli called him and said, “Samuel, my son.” “Here I am,” answered Samuel. 
>
><sup>17</sup> “What was the message he gave you?” Eli asked. “Don’t hide it from me. May God punish you and do so severely if you hide anything from me that he told you.” 

### The Calling of God: We must preach the word of God

>2 Timothy 3:16–4:5 (CSB) All Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching, for rebuking, for correcting, for training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work. I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is going to judge the living and the dead, and because of his appearing and his kingdom: Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; correct, rebuke, and encourage with great patience and teaching. For the time will come when people will not tolerate sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, will multiply teachers for themselves because they have an itch to hear what they want to hear. They will turn away from hearing the truth and will turn aside to myths. But as for you, exercise self-control in everything, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.

---

><sup>18</sup> So Samuel told him everything and did not hide anything from him. Eli responded, “He is the LORD. Let him do what he thinks is good.” 

### The Calling of God: God is just

>Psalm 89:14 (CSB) Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne; faithful love and truth go before you.

>Psalm 97:2 (CSB) Clouds and total darkness surround him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.

>Psalm 99:4 (CSB) The mighty King loves justice. You have established fairness; you have administered justice and righteousness in Jacob.

---

><sup>19</sup> Samuel grew. The LORD was with him, and he fulfilled everything Samuel prophesied. 
>
><sup>20</sup> All Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was a confirmed prophet of the LORD. 
>
><sup>21</sup> The LORD continued to appear in Shiloh, because there he revealed himself to Samuel by his word.

### The Calling of God: God has revealed himself

>John 1:18 (CSB) No one has ever seen God. The one and only Son, who is himself God and is at the Father’s side—he has revealed him.
