## The Study

### The Fighting Has Only Just Begun

Moses had handed over the leadership of Israel to Joshua. Joshua led the Israelites to possess the land.

>Judges 1:1-3 After the death of Joshua, the Israelites inquired of the LORD, “Who will be the first to fight for us against the Canaanites? ” The LORD answered, “Judah is to go. I have handed the land over to him.”Judah said to his brother Simeon, “Come with me to my allotted territory, and let’s fight against the Canaanites. I will also go with you to your allotted territory.” So Simeon went with him.

The generation that possess and conquered the land that was promised to them only knew war.

What did Christ say about Israel?

>Matthew 11:12 From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been suffering violence, and the violent have been seizing it by force.

What did Christ say about his coming?

>Matthew 10:34–36 Don’t assume that I came to bring peace on the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I came to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and a man’s enemies will be the members of his household.

What did all of this violence ultimately brought?

>Colossians 2:13-15 And when you were dead in trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, he made you alive with him and forgave us all our trespasses. He erased the certificate of debt, with its obligations, that was against us and opposed to us, and has taken it away by nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the rulers and authorities and disgraced them publicly; he triumphed over them in him.

Keep this in mind when more giants trying to come into the land *after* Goliath is defeated.

### The War Waged in the Heart

>Judges 2:1-5 The angel of the LORD went up from Gilgal to Bochim and said, “I brought you out of Egypt and led you into the land I had promised to your ancestors. I also said: I will never break my covenant with you. You are not to make a covenant with the inhabitants of this land. You are to tear down their altars. But you have not obeyed me. What have you done? Therefore, I now say: I will not drive out these people before you. They will be thorns in your sides, and their gods will be a trap for you.” When the angel of the LORD had spoken these words to all the Israelites, the people wept loudly. So they named that place Bochim and offered sacrifices there to the LORD.

#### People did good when they thought God was near

>Judges 2:7 The people worshiped the LORD throughout Joshua’s lifetime and during the lifetimes of the elders who outlived Joshua. They had seen all the LORD’s great works he had done for Israel.

#### People did evil when they thought God was far

>Judges 2:8-13 Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of 110. They buried him in the territory of his inheritance, in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. That whole generation was also gathered to their ancestors. After them another generation rose up who did not know the LORD or the works he had done for Israel. The Israelites did what was evil in the LORD’s sight. They worshiped the Baals and abandoned the LORD, the God of their ancestors, who had brought them out of Egypt. They followed other gods from the surrounding peoples and bowed down to them. They angered the LORD, for they abandoned him and worshiped Baal and the Ashtoreths.

Fun fact about Baal and Ashtoreth: Baal is the god of fertility and Ashtoreth is the goddess of fertility. The worship of these gods involved sexual immorality. The worship of these gods also involved child sacrifice.

What did Christ say about the heart?

>Matthew 5:21-22 “You have heard that it was said to our ancestors, Do not murder, and whoever murders will be subject to judgment. But I tell you, everyone who is angry with his brother or sister will be subject to judgment. Whoever insults his brother or sister will be subject to the court. Whoever says, ‘You fool! ’ will be subject to hellfire.

>Matthew 5:27-28 “You have heard that it was said, Do not commit adultery. But I tell you, everyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

Just because the people did right when they thought God was near doesn't make it right. It has always been about the heart.

God knew that. That is why he sent his Son.

>Matthew 5:17-20 “Don’t think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to abolish but to fulfill. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or one stroke of a letter will pass away from the law until all things are accomplished. Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commands and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever does and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never get into the kingdom of heaven.

### Yet the Triune God dwells in us

Christ is the way. 

How are we to possesses a righteousness that surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees?

>2 Corinthians 5:21 He made the one who did not know sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.

>Ezekiel 36:24–28 “ ‘For I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries, and will bring you into your own land. I will also sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your impurities and all your idols. I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will remove your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. I will place my Spirit within you and cause you to follow my statutes and carefully observe my ordinances. You will live in the land that I gave your ancestors; you will be my people, and I will be your God.

>1 Corinthians 6:19-20 Don’t you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were bought at a price. So glorify God with your body.

>John 14:23 Jesus answered, “If anyone loves me, he will keep my word. My Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.

#### There was no king in Israel

>Judges 17:6 In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did whatever seemed right to him.

>Judges 21:25 (ESV) In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.

#### God will bring a king over Israel

>Ruth 1:1 During the time of the judges, there was a famine in the land. A man left Bethlehem in Judah with his wife and two sons to stay in the territory of Moab for a while.

### But Christ is the King of kings

>1 Timothy 6:13-16 In the presence of God, who gives life to all, and of Christ Jesus, who gave a good confession before Pontius Pilate, I charge you to keep this command without fault or failure until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ. God will bring this about in his own time. He is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings, and the Lord of lords, who alone is immortal and who lives in unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or can see, to him be honor and eternal power. Amen.

## The Psalm

>Psalm 51  
>For the choir director. A psalm of David, when the prophet Nathan came to him after he had gone to Bathsheba. 
>
><sup>1</sup> Be gracious to me, God, according to your faithful love; according to your abundant compassion, blot out my rebellion. 
>
><sup>2</sup> Completely wash away my guilt and cleanse me from my sin. 
>
><sup>3</sup> For I am conscious of my rebellion, and my sin is always before me. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Against you—you alone—I have sinned and done this evil in your sight. So you are right when you pass sentence; you are blameless when you judge. 
>
><sup>5</sup> Indeed, I was guilty when I was born; I was sinful when my mother conceived me. 
>
><sup>6</sup> Surely you desire integrity in the inner self, and you teach me wisdom deep within. 
>
><sup>7</sup> Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow. 
>
><sup>8</sup> Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones you have crushed rejoice. 
>
><sup>9</sup> Turn your face away from my sins and blot out all my guilt. 
>
><sup>10</sup> God, create a clean heart for me and renew a steadfast spirit within me. 
>
><sup>11</sup> Do not banish me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me.

>
><sup>13</sup> Then I will teach the rebellious your ways, and sinners will return to you.

><sup>15</sup> Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise. 
>
><sup>16</sup> You do not want a sacrifice, or I would give it; you are not pleased with a burnt offering. 
>
><sup>17</sup> The sacrifice pleasing to God is a broken spirit. You will not despise a broken and humbled heart, God. 
>
><sup>18</sup> In your good pleasure, cause Zion to prosper; build the walls of Jerusalem. 
>
><sup>19</sup> Then you will delight in righteous sacrifices, whole burnt offerings; then bulls will be offered on your altar.
