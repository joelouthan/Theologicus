## About

<img class="profile-pic" src="jlouthan-ai-starry-back-500-01.png">Trying to spend all of my days with God. I belong to my Beloved and my Beloved is mine forevermore. Also, Sarah's husband and Papa to a few kiddos. Residing in Versailles, KY. Member of [Reforming Truth Church](https://reformingtruth.church). Joyfully ex-Evangelical turned Reformed Baptist--[1689 Confessional](confession-1689/index.md).

All of my life to live all of my days to express just how much God loves us. Hope to preach the goodness of God. Therefore, [Theologicus](https://theologic.us) is my attempt to prepare so that one day I can preach every day for the rest of my life and twice on Sunday--for the sake of his great name and his glory alone.

And if I have fifteen minutes to spare in my day, I'm [pretty mediocre at StarCraft 2](https://starcraft2.com/en-us/profile/1/1/9753175).
