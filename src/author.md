## About

<img class="profile-pic" src="jlouthan-ai-starry-back-500-01.png">I am Joseph L. Louthan. I am trying to spend all of my days with God. I belong to my Beloved and my Beloved is mine forevermore. Also, Sarah's husband and Papa to a few kiddos. In Central Kentucky. Elder Candidate of [Reforming Truth Church](https://reformingtruth.church/). Joyfully ex-Evangelical turned [Reformed Baptist--1689 Confessional](https://theologic.us/confession-1689/).

All of my life to live all of my days to express just how much God loves us. Hope to preach the goodness of God. Therefore, [Theologicus](https://theologic.us/) is my attempt to prepare for that one day that I get to preach every day for the rest of my life and twice on Sunday--for the sake of his great name and his glory alone.

And if I have fifteen minutes to spare in my day, I'm intensely mediocre at [StarCraft 2](https://starcraft2.blizzard.com/en-us/).
