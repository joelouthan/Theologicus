# Praying Through: Psalm 119:22

## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:22 (CSB) Take insult and contempt away from me, for I have kept your decrees.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

The only way I have kept your decrees
* is because
* your Son
* lived and bled
* for me.

Take my sins.

Take my iniquities.

Take my soul.

I love you with all of my heart.

Amen.
