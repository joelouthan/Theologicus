# Praying Through: Psalm 116 Compassionate

## The Psalm

>Psalm 116 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> I love the LORD because he has heard my appeal for mercy. 
>
><sup>2</sup> Because he has turned his ear to me, I will call out to him as long as I live. 
>
><sup>3</sup> The ropes of death were wrapped around me, and the torments of Sheol overcame me; I encountered trouble and sorrow. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Then I called on the name of the LORD: “LORD, save me!” 
>
><sup>5</sup> The LORD is gracious and righteous; our God is compassionate. 
>
><sup>6</sup> The LORD guards the inexperienced; I was helpless, and he saved me. 
>
><sup>7</sup> Return to your rest, my soul, for the LORD has been good to you. 
>
><sup>8</sup> For you, LORD, rescued me from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling. 
>
><sup>9</sup> I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living. 
>
><sup>10</sup> I believed, even when I said, “I am severely oppressed.” 
>
><sup>11</sup> In my alarm I said, “Everyone is a liar.” 
>
><sup>12</sup> How can I repay the LORD for all the good he has done for me? 
>
><sup>13</sup> I will take the cup of salvation and call on the name of the LORD. 
>
><sup>14</sup> I will fulfill my vows to the LORD in the presence of all his people. 
>
><sup>15</sup> The death of his faithful ones is valuable in the LORD’s sight. 
>
><sup>16</sup> LORD, I am indeed your servant; I am your servant, the son of your female servant. You have loosened my bonds. 
>
><sup>17</sup> I will offer you a thanksgiving sacrifice and call on the name of the LORD. 
>
><sup>18</sup> I will fulfill my vows to the LORD in the presence of all his people, 
>
><sup>19</sup> in the courts of the LORD’s house— within you, Jerusalem. Hallelujah!
