# Praying Through: Psalm 119:26

## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:26 (CSB) I told you about my life, and you answered me; teach me your statutes.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

You are aleady knew who I was
* and who I am now
* a beast before you
* struggling mightily
* under the weight of my sin.

But you, my God,
* sent your Son
* to live and die
* so the back breaking burden of sin
* would be completely lifted off.

And now, I live to you.

Amen.
