# Praying Through: Psalm 110 Conquerer

## The Psalm

>Psalm 110 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A psalm of David. 
>
><sup>1</sup> This is the declaration of the LORD to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool.” 
>
><sup>2</sup> The LORD will extend your mighty scepter from Zion. Rule over your surrounding enemies. 
>
><sup>3</sup> Your people will volunteer on your day of battle. In holy splendor, from the womb of the dawn, the dew of your youth belongs to you. 
>
><sup>4</sup> The LORD has sworn an oath and will not take it back: “You are a priest forever according to the pattern of Melchizedek.” 
>
><sup>5</sup> The Lord is at your right hand; he will crush kings on the day of his anger.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Lord
</div>

I was a long rejector
* of your great gospel
* a treason traitor
* of your great rule
* a magnificient hater
* of your great love
* a terrible sinner
* of your great holiness.

But you have conquered
* my greatest and only enemy
* my own sin
* and have put my sin to open shame
* because you have taken my sin upon yourself
* and exposed yourself to open shame
* for my sake
* for my sake
* you died
* so I might live to you forever.

Be glorified
* in my life
* today.

Amen.
