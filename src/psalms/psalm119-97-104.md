# Praying Through: Psalm 119:97-104

## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:97–104 (CSB)  
><sup>97</sup> How I love your instruction! It is my meditation all day long. 
>
><sup>98</sup> Your command makes me wiser than my enemies, for it is always with me. 
>
><sup>99</sup> I have more insight than all my teachers because your decrees are my meditation. 
>
><sup>100</sup> I understand more than the elders because I obey your precepts. 
>
><sup>101</sup> I have kept my feet from every evil path to follow your word. 
>
><sup>102</sup> I have not turned from your judgments, for you yourself have instructed me. 
>
><sup>103</sup> How sweet your word is to my taste— sweeter than honey in my mouth. 
>
><sup>104</sup> I gain understanding from your precepts; therefore I hate every false way.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

May I never take for granted
* the way you have opened my eyes
* opened my ears
* unmute my tongue
* renewed my mind
* gave me a new heart
* given me new desires
* your Spirit dwelling in me
* Christ in me
* your home in me
* so that I can now
* understand
* and believe
* your Living Word.

Amen.
