# Praying Through: Psalm 119:27

## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:27 (CSB) Help me understand the meaning of your precepts so that I can meditate on your wonders.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

I need the fullness of your Holy Spirit!

So I can understand
* what you are saying
* with your mouth.

Speak to me, Lord!
* You have spoken
* Since you have spoken,
* Holy Spirit,
* I need you so I can know
* and understand
* and believe.

Help me!

Amen.
