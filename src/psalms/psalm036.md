# Psalm 36

>For the choir director. Of David, the LORDâ€™s servant. 
>
><sup>1</sup> An oracle within my heart concerning the transgression of the wicked person: Dread of God has no effect on him. 
>
><sup>2</sup> For with his flattering opinion of himself, he does not discover and hate his iniquity. 
>
><sup>3</sup> The words from his mouth are malicious and deceptive; he has stopped acting wisely and doing good. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Even on his bed he makes malicious plans. He sets himself on a path that is not good, and he does not reject evil. 
>
><sup>5</sup> LORD, your faithful love reaches to heaven, your faithfulness to the clouds. 
>
><sup>6</sup> Your righteousness is like the highest mountains, your judgments like the deepest sea. LORD, you preserve people and animals. 
>
><sup>7</sup> How priceless your faithful love is, God! People take refuge in the shadow of your wings. 
>
><sup>8</sup> They are filled from the abundance of your house. You let them drink from your refreshing stream. 
>
><sup>9</sup> For the wellspring of life is with you. By means of your light we see light. 
>
><sup>10</sup> Spread your faithful love over those who know you, and your righteousness over the upright in heart. 
>
><sup>11</sup> Do not let the foot of the arrogant come near me or the hand of the wicked drive me away. 
>
><sup>12</sup> There! The evildoers have fallen. They have been thrown down and cannot rise.
