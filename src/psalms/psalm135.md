# Praying Through: Psalm 135

## The Psalm

>Psalm 135 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> Hallelujah! Praise the name of the LORD. Give praise, you servants of the LORD 
>
><sup>2</sup> who stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God. 
>
><sup>3</sup> Praise the LORD, for the LORD is good; sing praise to his name, for it is delightful. 
>
><sup>4</sup> For the LORD has chosen Jacob for himself, Israel as his treasured possession. 
>
><sup>5</sup> For I know that the LORD is great; our Lord is greater than all gods. 
>
><sup>6</sup> The LORD does whatever he pleases in heaven and on earth, in the seas and all the depths. 
>
><sup>7</sup> He causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning for the rain and brings the wind from his storehouses. 
>
><sup>8</sup> He struck down the firstborn of Egypt, both people and animals. 
>
><sup>9</sup> He sent signs and wonders against you, Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his officials. 
>
><sup>10</sup> He struck down many nations and slaughtered mighty kings: 
>
><sup>11</sup> Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, and all the kings of Canaan. 
>
><sup>12</sup> He gave their land as an inheritance, an inheritance to his people Israel. 
>
><sup>13</sup> LORD, your name endures forever, your reputation, LORD, through all generations. 
>
><sup>14</sup> For the LORD will vindicate his people and have compassion on his servants. 
>
><sup>15</sup> The idols of the nations are of silver and gold, made by human hands. 
>
><sup>16</sup> They have mouths but cannot speak, eyes, but cannot see. 
>
><sup>17</sup> They have ears but cannot hear; indeed, there is no breath in their mouths. 
>
><sup>18</sup> Those who make them are just like them, as are all who trust in them. 
>
><sup>19</sup> House of Israel, bless the LORD! House of Aaron, bless the LORD! 
>
><sup>20</sup> House of Levi, bless the LORD! You who revere the LORD, bless the LORD! 
>
><sup>21</sup> Blessed be the LORD from Zion; he dwells in Jerusalem. Hallelujah!

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Completely Sovereign God,
</div>

Look at what you have done!
* you have chosen us
* to be your beloved
* treasured possession
* to love and adore
* from before the foundation of the world
* to be your own
* to be your people
* and you would be our great God in heaven.

You have saved us
* from the bondage of sin
* from the destruction of death
* from the disease of wickedness and shame.

And we know this
* because you sent your only begotten Son
* Jesus Christ
* to live and die for us
* and to save us
* and be with us
* forevermore.

We shall praise you
* all of our days.

We love you
* you are our Father in heaven.

Amen.
