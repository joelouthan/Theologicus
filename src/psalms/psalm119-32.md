# Praying Through: Psalm 119:32

## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:32 (CSB) I pursue the way of your commands, for you broaden my understanding. 

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

I only pursue understanding
* because of your great grace
* and tender mercies
* you saved me
* you renewed my mind
* and gave me a new heart
* with new desires.

Desires for you
* my God.

Once more
* you gave me yourself
* your Spirit
* and your precious Son.

I may not ever know you fully
* but I know you truly
* I know you now truly
* because I have your Son.

Amen.
