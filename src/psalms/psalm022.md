# Psalm 22

>For the choir director: according to “The Deer of the Dawn.” A psalm of David. 
>
><sup>1</sup> My God, my God, why have you abandoned me? Why are you so far from my deliverance and from my words of groaning? 
>
><sup>2</sup> My God, I cry by day, but you do not answer, by night, yet I have no rest. 
>
><sup>3</sup> But you are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Our ancestors trusted in you; they trusted, and you rescued them. 
>
><sup>5</sup> They cried to you and were set free; they trusted in you and were not disgraced. 
>
><sup>6</sup> But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by mankind and despised by people. 
>
><sup>7</sup> Everyone who sees me mocks me; they sneer and shake their heads: 
>
><sup>8</sup> “He relies on the LORD; let him save him; let the LORD rescue him, since he takes pleasure in him.” 
>
><sup>9</sup> It was you who brought me out of the womb, making me secure at my mother’s breast. 
>
><sup>10</sup> I was given over to you at birth; you have been my God from my mother’s womb. 
>
><sup>11</sup> Don’t be far from me, because distress is near and there’s no one to help. 
>
><sup>12</sup> Many bulls surround me; strong ones of Bashan encircle me. 
>
><sup>13</sup> They open their mouths against me— lions, mauling and roaring. 
>
><sup>14</sup> I am poured out like water, and all my bones are disjointed; my heart is like wax, melting within me. 
>
><sup>15</sup> My strength is dried up like baked clay; my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth. You put me into the dust of death. 
>
><sup>16</sup> For dogs have surrounded me; a gang of evildoers has closed in on me; they pierced my hands and my feet. 
>
><sup>17</sup> I can count all my bones; people look and stare at me. 
>
><sup>18</sup> They divided my garments among themselves, and they cast lots for my clothing. 
>
><sup>19</sup> But you, LORD, don’t be far away. My strength, come quickly to help me. 
>
><sup>20</sup> Rescue my life from the sword, my only life from the power of these dogs. 
>
><sup>21</sup> Save me from the lion’s mouth, from the horns of wild oxen. You answered me! 
>
><sup>22</sup> I will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters; I will praise you in the assembly. 
>
><sup>23</sup> You who fear the LORD, praise him! All you descendants of Jacob, honor him! All you descendants of Israel, revere him! 
>
><sup>24</sup> For he has not despised or abhorred the torment of the oppressed. He did not hide his face from him but listened when he cried to him for help. 
>
><sup>25</sup> I will give praise in the great assembly because of you; I will fulfill my vows before those who fear you. 
>
><sup>26</sup> The humble will eat and be satisfied; those who seek the LORD will praise him. May your hearts live forever! 
>
><sup>27</sup> All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the LORD. All the families of the nations will bow down before you, 
>
><sup>28</sup> for kingship belongs to the LORD; he rules the nations. 
>
><sup>29</sup> All who prosper on earth will eat and bow down; all those who go down to the dust will kneel before him— even the one who cannot preserve his life. 
>
><sup>30</sup> Their descendants will serve him; the next generation will be told about the Lord. 
>
><sup>31</sup> They will come and declare his righteousness; to a people yet to be born they will declare what he has done.
