# Praying Through: Psalm 119:25

## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:25 (CSB) My life is down in the dust; give me life through your word.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

My bones were in the grave

Until you called my name
* and resurrect me
* from dead in my sins
* unto everlasting life.

I will always praise you.

Amen.
