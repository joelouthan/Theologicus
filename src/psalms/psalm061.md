><sup>1</sup> God, hear my cry; pay attention to my prayer. 
>
><sup>2</sup> I call to you from the ends of the earth when my heart is without strength. Lead me to a rock that is high above me, 
>
><sup>3</sup> for you have been a refuge for me, a strong tower in the face of the enemy. 
>
><sup>4</sup> I will dwell in your tent forever and take refuge under the shelter of your wings. Selah

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
You Are My Strength
</div>

I will never forget
* my deepest sins
* my anguish
* my torment
* my chaos
* my own iniquity

And you were so far
* I thought I knew you
* and I could not see your face
* All that appeared to me
* was darkness
* and dread
* and death
* and disease
* and wickedness.

I did not knew you well enough
* because your hand was always on my soul
* your grace always surrounded me
* your righteousness always clothed me
* your peace was placed in my heart.

My response
* to your goodness
* was the worst.
* But when I was faithless
* you are were absolutely faithful
* and just to forgive my sin
* and cleansed me of my sin
* over and over.

You will never tire 
* of rescuing me
* I need your help
* always I need you
* be my God
* and my Lord forever.

Amen.
