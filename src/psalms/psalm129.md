# Praying Through: Psalm 129

## The Psalm

>Psalm 129 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A song of ascents. 
>
><sup>1</sup> Since my youth they have often attacked me— let Israel say— 
>
><sup>2</sup> since my youth they have often attacked me, but they have not prevailed against me. 
>
><sup>3</sup> Plowmen plowed over my back; they made their furrows long. 
>
><sup>4</sup> The LORD is righteous; he has cut the ropes of the wicked. 
>
><sup>5</sup> Let all who hate Zion be driven back in disgrace. 
>
><sup>6</sup> Let them be like grass on the rooftops, which withers before it grows up 
>
><sup>7</sup> and can’t even fill the hands of the reaper or the arms of the one who binds sheaves. 
>
><sup>8</sup> Then none who pass by will say, “May the LORD’s blessing be on you. We bless you in the name of the LORD.”

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Conqueror,
</div>

I have no enemies
* other than Satan
* sin
* death
* demons
* and hell.

They have attacked me since my youth
* and many times
* it feels like 
* they have conquered me
* they alone have sought
* to grind my bones into dust
* they alone have sought
* to see the end of my life.

And they nearly did.

But You, O Lord,
* are always compassionate
* and you took pity on me
* and you saved me
* from darkness
* from the grip of sin
* from the power of death.

I will praise your name
* Lord Jesus.

Amen.
