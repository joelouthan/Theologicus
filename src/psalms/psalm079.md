# Praying Through: Psalm 79 Faith

## The Psalm

## The Prayer

Faith
</div>


You are the Almighty God
  who rules and reigns
  over all the earth
  who demands perfection
  and holiness
  and righteousness 
  in order to dwell with you.

But you demand something
  that is not in us
  that we cannot make
  because we are so far from
  and we have turned from you
  we have rejected your grace
  and ignored your mercies
  because we thought we knew our own way.

So you sent your Son
  not only to guide us and teach us
  but to live for us and die for us
  so that we would live and give glory to you.

Open our eyes to see
  our ears to hear
  renew our minds
  spirit in our bodies
  remove our old cancerous hearts
  and replace them with your heart
  so that we would have new desires for you alone.

Blessed be your glorious name forever.

Amen.
