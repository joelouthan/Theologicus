# Praying Through: Psalm 79 Faith

## The Psalm

>Psalm 79 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A psalm of Asaph. 
>
><sup>1</sup> God, the nations have invaded your inheritance, desecrated your holy temple, and turned Jerusalem into ruins. 
>
><sup>2</sup> They gave the corpses of your servants to the birds of the sky for food, the flesh of your faithful ones to the beasts of the earth. 
>
><sup>3</sup> They poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them. 
>
><sup>4</sup> We have become an object of reproach to our neighbors, a source of mockery and ridicule to those around us. 
>
><sup>5</sup> How long, LORD? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealousy keep burning like fire? 
>
><sup>6</sup> Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t acknowledge you, on the kingdoms that don’t call on your name, 
>
><sup>7</sup> for they have devoured Jacob and devastated his homeland. 
>
><sup>8</sup> Do not hold past iniquities against us; let your compassion come to us quickly, for we have become very weak. 
>
><sup>9</sup> God of our salvation, help us, for the glory of your name. Rescue us and atone for our sins, for your name’s sake. 
>
><sup>10</sup> Why should the nations ask, “Where is their God?” Before our eyes, let vengeance for the shed blood of your servants be known among the nations. 
>
><sup>11</sup> Let the groans of the prisoners reach you; according to your great power, preserve those condemned to die. 
>
><sup>12</sup> Pay back sevenfold to our neighbors the reproach they have hurled at you, Lord. 
>
><sup>13</sup> Then we, your people, the sheep of your pasture, will thank you forever; we will declare your praise to generation after generation.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Faith
</div>

You are the Almighty God
* who rules and reigns
* over all the earth
* who demands perfection
* and holiness
* and righteousness 
* in order to dwell with you.

But you demand something
* that is not in us
* that we cannot make
* because we are so far from
* and we have turned from you
* we have rejected your grace
* and ignored your mercies
* because we thought we knew our own way.

So you sent your Son
* not only to guide us and teach us
* but to live for us and die for us
* so that we would live and give glory to you.

Open our eyes to see
* our ears to hear
* renew our minds
* spirit in our bodies
* remove our old cancerous hearts
* and replace them with your heart
* so that we would have new desires for you alone.

Blessed be your glorious name forever.

Amen.
