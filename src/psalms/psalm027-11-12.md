# Praying Through: Psalm 27:11-12

## The Psalm

>Psalm 27 (CSB)    
>
><sup>11</sup> Because of my adversaries, show me your way, LORD, and lead me on a level path. 
>
><sup>12</sup> Do not give me over to the will of my foes, for false witnesses rise up against me, breathing violence. 

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">O Lord</div>

My enemies have been numerous,
* and they attack me relentless.
They do not rest when I am sleeping,
* they even attack me in my dreams.

My scars run deep,
* my bones break.
But you, O Lord, are my healer and my restorer.
* You sent your Son
* to care for the sick and wounded.
* Be attentive to my pain
* and I will rejoice before you.
You are the sweet love of my life forever.

Amen.
