# Praying Through: Psalm 108 Exalted

## The Psalm

>Psalm 108 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A song. A psalm of David. 
>
><sup>1</sup> My heart is confident, God; I will sing; I will sing praises with the whole of my being. 
>
><sup>2</sup> Wake up, harp and lyre! I will wake up the dawn. 
>
><sup>3</sup> I will praise you, LORD, among the peoples; I will sing praises to you among the nations. 
>
><sup>4</sup> For your faithful love is higher than the heavens, and your faithfulness reaches to the clouds. 
>
><sup>5</sup> God, be exalted above the heavens, and let your glory be over the whole earth. 
>
><sup>6</sup> Save with your right hand and answer me so that those you love may be rescued. 
>
><sup>7</sup> God has spoken in his sanctuary: “I will celebrate! I will divide up Shechem. I will apportion the Valley of Succoth. 
>
><sup>8</sup> Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine, and Ephraim is my helmet; Judah is my scepter. 
>
><sup>9</sup> Moab is my washbasin; I throw my sandal on Edom. I shout in triumph over Philistia.” 
>
><sup>10</sup> Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom? 
>
><sup>11</sup> God, haven’t you rejected us? God, you do not march out with our armies. 
>
><sup>12</sup> Give us aid against the foe, for human help is worthless. 
>
><sup>13</sup> With God we will perform valiantly; he will trample our foes.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Lord
</div>

I faced my absolute enemies  
* they are crouching  
* waiting for me to slip and fall  
* so that they can pounce  
* and devour my heart and soul  

And I have fallen  
* a million times  
* this week  
* this day  
* this hour  
* I am helpless  
* the dogs  
* they chew on my bones  

But all that I know  
* is that your Son  
* bled and died for me  
* and has put these dogs  
* to open shame  
* I am in Christ alone  
* and I am safe  

No matter what evil befalls me  
* I will sing praises to your name  
* O Lord  
* because you alone are worthy  
* and worthy to be praised  

Amen
