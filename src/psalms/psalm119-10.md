# Praying Through: Psalm 119:10

## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:10 (CSB) I have sought you with all my heart; donâ€™t let me wander from your commands.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

You are the one that gave me this heart
* and your Spirit
* and your Son
* with this faith
* and this repentance
* and this adoption
* with your righteousness
* and holiness
* and perfection.

You will never lose me
* because you bought me
* with a price.

I love you.

Amen.
