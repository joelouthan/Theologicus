# Praying Through: Psalm 23:5a Circumstances Abound

## The Psalm

>Psalm 23:5a (CSB)   You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies

## The Prayer

<div style='font-variant: small-caps;'>
My God,
</div>

I have been crushed and
* discarded a hundred times.
* But, I have warred against you
* thousand more.

Yet, you sent your Son to live
* and die for me.

And now I live for you.

I will never understand
* why you saved me,
* but I only know that
* because I have sin much
* You have forgiven much.

Now I know you let me sit
* at your table,
* when I should been
* condemned for treason.

You knew I was an enemy,
* and you then declared me
* as your friend.

My God, remind me always that,
* I do not do battle
* against prisoners of war,
* but against the rulers
* who imprisoned them.

Give me your almighty strength,
* and your invincible armour,
* and let me help
* you set the captives free.

In your Sonâ€™s name I pray. Amen.
