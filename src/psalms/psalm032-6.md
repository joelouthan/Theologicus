# Praying Through: Psalm 32:6

## The Psalm

>Psalm 32:6 (CSB)   Therefore let everyone who is faithful pray to you immediately. When great floodwaters come, they will not reach him.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
God of my little belief
</div>

Oh how many times, O Lord,
* have I whispered nothings
* gave half-hearted thanks
* prayed and did not believe
* spoke and did not think it was real.

When I was an ungodly husband
* and my weak non-prayers were unanswered
* When I was a sinful subject
* and any other king would ignore me
* or worse yet
* have me executed
* for high treason?

But that is not you.

You are the King who sends his heralds
* to tell the nations
* about the good news
* that the God of the universe
* relentlessly
* passionately
* persistently
* wonderfully
* goes after us.
* Even those of us
* who are the most vile
* most wicked
* the chief of sinners
* like me.

You rescued me
* you called on me
* I call on you.
* You turn your ear to me
* because I am your son
* because of Your Son
* because of Your Spirit within me
* becasue you love me.

Be exalted, O Lord.
Be exalted higher and higher.
