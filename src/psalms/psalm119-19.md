# Praying Through: Psalm 119:19

## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:19 (CSB) I am a resident alien on earth; do not hide your commands from me.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

I am wondering through this wasteland  
  this is not my home  
  I need to get home  
  so I can be with you  
  forever.

Speak to me!  
  Speak to me!  
  I have your word.

Yet  
  And you have spoken to me  
  and you are speaking to me  
  and you will forever speak to me  
  because you are mine  
  and I am yours  
  forever.

Amen.
