## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
You Are My God
</div>


My enemies feebly
  failed to destroy me
  They attacked me from all sides
  They have punctured my heart 
  with all of their fiery arrows
  surely I was dead
  my soul was gone.

But I belong to you
  you are my everlasting God
  who have sent His Son
  to live and die for me
  so that I will never perish
  but have everlasting life.

Your love
  is what my life runs on.
  Be my everything
  and be with me forever.

Amen.
