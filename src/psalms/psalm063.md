# Praying Through: Psalm 63

## The Psalm

>Psalm 63 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A psalm of David. When he was in the Wilderness of Judah. 
>
><sup>1</sup> God, you are my God; I eagerly seek you. I thirst for you; my body faints for you in a land that is dry, desolate, and without water. 
>
><sup>2</sup> So I gaze on you in the sanctuary to see your strength and your glory. 
>
><sup>3</sup> My lips will glorify you because your faithful love is better than life. 
>
><sup>4</sup> So I will bless you as long as I live; at your name, I will lift up my hands. 
>
><sup>5</sup> You satisfy me as with rich food; my mouth will praise you with joyful lips. 
>
><sup>6</sup> When I think of you as I lie on my bed, I meditate on you during the night watches 
>
><sup>7</sup> because you are my helper; I will rejoice in the shadow of your wings. 
>
><sup>8</sup> I follow close to you; your right hand holds on to me. 
>
><sup>9</sup> But those who intend to destroy my life will go into the depths of the earth. 
>
><sup>10</sup> They will be given over to the power of the sword; they will become a meal for jackals. 
>
><sup>11</sup> But the king will rejoice in God; all who swear by him will boast, for the mouths of liars will be shut.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
You Are My God
</div>

My enemies feebly
  failed to destroy me
  They attacked me from all sides
  They have punctured my heart 
  with all of their fiery arrows
  surely I was dead
  my soul was gone.

But I belong to you
  you are my everlasting God
  who have sent His Son
  to live and die for me
  so that I will never perish
  but have everlasting life.

Your love
  is what my life runs on.
  Be my everything
  and be with me forever.

Amen.
