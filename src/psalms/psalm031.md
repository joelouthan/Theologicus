# Psalm 31

>For the choir director. A psalm of David. 
>
><sup>1</sup> LORD, I seek refuge in you; let me never be disgraced. Save me by your righteousness. 
>
><sup>2</sup> Listen closely to me; rescue me quickly. Be a rock of refuge for me, a mountain fortress to save me. 
>
><sup>3</sup> For you are my rock and my fortress; you lead and guide me for your name’s sake. 
>
><sup>4</sup> You will free me from the net that is secretly set for me, for you are my refuge. 
>
><sup>5</sup> Into your hand I entrust my spirit; you have redeemed me, LORD, God of truth. 
>
><sup>6</sup> I hate those who are devoted to worthless idols, but I trust in the LORD. 
>
><sup>7</sup> I will rejoice and be glad in your faithful love because you have seen my affliction. You know the troubles of my soul 
>
><sup>8</sup> and have not handed me over to the enemy. You have set my feet in a spacious place. 
>
><sup>9</sup> Be gracious to me, LORD, because I am in distress; my eyes are worn out from frustration— my whole being as well. 
>
><sup>10</sup> Indeed, my life is consumed with grief and my years with groaning; my strength has failed because of my iniquity, and my bones waste away. 
>
><sup>11</sup> I am ridiculed by all my adversaries and even by my neighbors. I am dreaded by my acquaintances; those who see me in the street run from me. 
>
><sup>12</sup> I am forgotten: gone from memory like a dead person—like broken pottery. 
>
><sup>13</sup> I have heard the gossip of many; terror is on every side. When they conspired against me, they plotted to take my life. 
>
><sup>14</sup> But I trust in you, LORD; I say, “You are my God.” 
>
><sup>15</sup> The course of my life is in your power; rescue me from the power of my enemies and from my persecutors. 
>
><sup>16</sup> Make your face shine on your servant; save me by your faithful love. 
>
><sup>17</sup> LORD, do not let me be disgraced when I call on you. Let the wicked be disgraced; let them be quiet in Sheol. 
>
><sup>18</sup> Let lying lips that arrogantly speak against the righteous in proud contempt be silenced. 
>
><sup>19</sup> How great is your goodness, which you have stored up for those who fear you. In the presence of everyone you have acted for those who take refuge in you. 
>
><sup>20</sup> You hide them in the protection of your presence; you conceal them in a shelter from human schemes, from quarrelsome tongues. 
>
><sup>21</sup> Blessed be the LORD, for he has wondrously shown his faithful love to me in a city under siege. 
>
><sup>22</sup> In my alarm I said, “I am cut off from your sight.” But you heard the sound of my pleading when I cried to you for help. 
>
><sup>23</sup> Love the LORD, all his faithful ones. The LORD protects the loyal, but fully repays the arrogant. 
>
><sup>24</sup> Be strong, and let your heart be courageous, all you who put your hope in the LORD.
