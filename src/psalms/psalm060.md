# Praying Through: Psalm 60

## The Psalm

>Psalm 60 (CSB)  
>For the choir director: according to “The Lily of Testimony.” A Miktam of David for teaching. When he fought with Aram-naharaim and Aram-zobah, and Joab returned and struck Edom in Salt Valley, killing twelve thousand. 
>
><sup>1</sup> God, you have rejected us; you have broken us down; you have been angry. Restore us! 
>
><sup>2</sup> You have shaken the land and split it open. Heal its fissures, for it shudders. 
>
><sup>3</sup> You have made your people suffer hardship; you have given us wine to drink that made us stagger. 
>
><sup>4</sup> You have given a signal flag to those who fear you, so that they can flee before the archers. Selah 
>
><sup>5</sup> Save with your right hand, and answer me, so that those you love may be rescued. 
>
><sup>6</sup> God has spoken in his sanctuary: “I will celebrate! I will divide up Shechem. I will apportion the Valley of Succoth. 
>
><sup>7</sup> Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine, and Ephraim is my helmet; Judah is my scepter. 
>
><sup>8</sup> Moab is my washbasin. I throw my sandal on Edom; I shout in triumph over Philistia.” 
>
><sup>9</sup> Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom? 
>
><sup>10</sup> God, haven’t you rejected us? God, you do not march out with our armies. 
>
><sup>11</sup> Give us aid against the foe, for human help is worthless. 
>
><sup>12</sup> With God we will perform valiantly; he will trample our foes.


## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
You Are With Me
</div>

The battles I have seen
The bloodshed upon my hands
The hurt I have caused
The wounds I have made
Was all of my actions.

I have been hurt too
And that does not make it right

I am sorry Lord
For the hurt I have caused.

Will you save me?

Will you give me a tender heart
To forgive others
And love others
And to seek reconcilation
and help heal others?

I am so sorry Lord
For all of my sins.

Make me like your Son
And turn my heart towards you.

Amen.
