# Praying Through: Psalm 119:33

## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:33 (CSB) Teach me, LORD, the meaning of your statutes, and I will always keep them. 

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

Lord,
  Give me your word
  Speak to me
  and you have spoken to me
  because you gave me your word.

Write your word upon my heart
  You and your Son
  come live in my heart
  Your Spirit
  seals my heart
  and I will never sin against you
  because your Son has perfectly taken my sin
  and I have his perfect righteousness.
  
Forever.

Amen.
