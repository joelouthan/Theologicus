# Praying Through: Psalm 68

## The Psalm

>Psalm 68 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director. A psalm of David. A song. 
>
><sup>1</sup> God arises. His enemies scatter, and those who hate him flee from his presence. 
>
><sup>2</sup> As smoke is blown away, so you blow them away. As wax melts before the fire, so the wicked are destroyed before God. 
>
><sup>3</sup> But the righteous are glad; they rejoice before God and celebrate with joy. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Sing to God! Sing praises to his name. Exalt him who rides on the clouds— his name is the LORD—and celebrate before him. 
>
><sup>5</sup> God in his holy dwelling is a father of the fatherless and a champion of widows. 
>
><sup>6</sup> God provides homes for those who are deserted. He leads out the prisoners to prosperity, but the rebellious live in a scorched land. 
>
><sup>7</sup> God, when you went out before your people, when you marched through the desert, Selah 
>
><sup>8</sup> the earth trembled and the skies poured rain before God, the God of Sinai, before God, the God of Israel. 
>
><sup>9</sup> You, God, showered abundant rain; you revived your inheritance when it languished. 
>
><sup>10</sup> Your people settled in it; God, you provided for the poor by your goodness. 
>
><sup>11</sup> The Lord gave the command; a great company of women brought the good news: 
>
><sup>12</sup> “The kings of the armies flee—they flee!” She who stays at home divides the spoil. 
>
><sup>13</sup> While you lie among the sheep pens, the wings of a dove are covered with silver, and its feathers with glistening gold. 
>
><sup>14</sup> When the Almighty scattered kings in the land, it snowed on Zalmon. 
>
><sup>15</sup> Mount Bashan is God’s towering mountain; Mount Bashan is a mountain of many peaks. 
>
><sup>16</sup> Why gaze with envy, you mountain peaks, at the mountain God desired for his abode? The LORD will dwell there forever! 
>
><sup>17</sup> God’s chariots are tens of thousands, thousands and thousands; the Lord is among them in the sanctuary as he was at Sinai. 
>
><sup>18</sup> You ascended to the heights, taking away captives; you received gifts from people, even from the rebellious, so that the LORD God might dwell there. 
>
><sup>19</sup> Blessed be the Lord! Day after day he bears our burdens; God is our salvation. Selah 
>
><sup>20</sup> Our God is a God of salvation, and escape from death belongs to the LORD my Lord. 
>
><sup>21</sup> Surely God crushes the heads of his enemies, the hairy brow of one who goes on in his guilty acts. 
>
><sup>22</sup> The Lord said, “I will bring them back from Bashan; I will bring them back from the depths of the sea 
>
><sup>23</sup> so that your foot may wade in blood and your dogs’ tongues may have their share from the enemies.” 
>
><sup>24</sup> People have seen your procession, God, the procession of my God, my King, in the sanctuary. 
>
><sup>25</sup> Singers lead the way, with musicians following; among them are young women playing tambourines. 
>
><sup>26</sup> Bless God in the assemblies; bless the LORD from the fountain of Israel. 
>
><sup>27</sup> There is Benjamin, the youngest, leading them, the rulers of Judah in their assembly, the rulers of Zebulun, the rulers of Naphtali. 
>
><sup>28</sup> Your God has decreed your strength. Show your strength, God, you who have acted on our behalf. 
>
><sup>29</sup> Because of your temple at Jerusalem, kings will bring tribute to you. 
>
><sup>30</sup> Rebuke the beast in the reeds, the herd of bulls with the calves of the peoples. Trample underfoot those with bars of silver. Scatter the peoples who take pleasure in war. 
>
><sup>31</sup> Ambassadors will come from Egypt; Cush will stretch out its hands to God. 
>
><sup>32</sup> Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth; sing praise to the Lord, Selah 
>
><sup>33</sup> to him who rides in the ancient, highest heavens. Look, he thunders with his powerful voice! 
>
><sup>34</sup> Ascribe power to God. His majesty is over Israel; his power is among the clouds. 
>
><sup>35</sup> God, you are awe-inspiring in your sanctuaries. The God of Israel gives power and strength to his people. Blessed be God!

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Worthy is Your Power
</div>

I have seen
* texts
* empty promises
* words
* feelings
* good intentions
* exchanges
* hopes
* doubts
* knowledge
* wisdom
* charity
* love
* that could try to fix me.

I was beyond repair
* nothing on this earth
* would make me whole
* would seal my heart
* would fulfill eternity inside
* right my mind
* open my eyes
* unmute my tongue
* unplug my ears
* clear my mind
* give a beat to my heart
* give me life.

Nothing. Because I have tried it all
* and I found the world wanting.

You gave me your Spirit
* and now I am fully alive in you.

Preserve me, O God
* lay your power upon me
* to take me to the end
* when I get to hold your Son's face
* in my little hands
* forever and ever.

I love you.

Amen.
