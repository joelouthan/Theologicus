# Psalm 33

><sup>1</sup> Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous ones; praise from the upright is beautiful. 
>
><sup>2</sup> Praise the LORD with the lyre; make music to him with a ten-stringed harp. 
>
><sup>3</sup> Sing a new song to him; play skillfully on the strings, with a joyful shout. 
>
><sup>4</sup> For the word of the LORD is right, and all his work is trustworthy. 
>
><sup>5</sup> He loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of the LORD’s unfailing love. 
>
><sup>6</sup> The heavens were made by the word of the LORD, and all the stars, by the breath of his mouth. 
>
><sup>7</sup> He gathers the water of the sea into a heap; he puts the depths into storehouses. 
>
><sup>8</sup> Let the whole earth fear the LORD; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. 
>
><sup>9</sup> For he spoke, and it came into being; he commanded, and it came into existence. 
>
><sup>10</sup> The LORD frustrates the counsel of the nations; he thwarts the plans of the peoples. 
>
><sup>11</sup> The counsel of the LORD stands forever, the plans of his heart from generation to generation. 
>
><sup>12</sup> Happy is the nation whose God is the LORD— the people he has chosen to be his own possession! 
>
><sup>13</sup> The LORD looks down from heaven; he observes everyone. 
>
><sup>14</sup> He gazes on all the inhabitants of the earth from his dwelling place. 
>
><sup>15</sup> He forms the hearts of them all; he considers all their works. 
>
><sup>16</sup> A king is not saved by a large army; a warrior will not be rescued by great strength. 
>
><sup>17</sup> The horse is a false hope for safety; it provides no escape by its great power. 
>
><sup>18</sup> But look, the LORD keeps his eye on those who fear him— those who depend on his faithful love 
>
><sup>19</sup> to rescue them from death and to keep them alive in famine. 
>
><sup>20</sup> We wait for the LORD; he is our help and shield. 
>
><sup>21</sup> For our hearts rejoice in him because we trust in his holy name. 
>
><sup>22</sup> May your faithful love rest on us, LORD, for we put our hope in you.
