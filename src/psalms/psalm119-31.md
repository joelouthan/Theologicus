# Praying Through: Psalm 119:31

## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:31 (CSB) I cling to your decrees; LORD, do not put me to shame. 

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

Upon your words
* you as the source of life
* I have nowhere else to go to
* for you alone
* have the words
* of eternal life
* and I know
* that your Son is
* the Holy One of God.

Save me, Lord
* and bring me all the way home.

Amen.
