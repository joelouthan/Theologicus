# Praying Through: Psalm 2

<p style="clear:both;">

## The Psalm

>Psalm 2 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain? 
>
><sup>2</sup> The kings of the earth take their stand, and the rulers conspire together against the LORD and his Anointed One: 
>
><sup>3</sup> “Let’s tear off their chains and throw their ropes off of us.” 
>
><sup>4</sup> The one enthroned in heaven laughs; the Lord ridicules them. 
>
><sup>5</sup> Then he speaks to them in his anger and terrifies them in his wrath: 
>
><sup>6</sup> “I have installed my king on Zion, my holy mountain.” 
>
><sup>7</sup> I will declare the LORD’s decree. He said to me, “You are my Son; today I have become your Father. 
>
><sup>8</sup> Ask of me, and I will make the nations your inheritance and the ends of the earth your possession. 
>
><sup>9</sup> You will break them with an iron scepter; you will shatter them like pottery.” 
>
><sup>10</sup> So now, kings, be wise; receive instruction, you judges of the earth. 
>
><sup>11</sup> Serve the LORD with reverential awe and rejoice with trembling. 
>
><sup>12</sup> Pay homage to the Son or he will be angry and you will perish in your rebellion, for his anger may ignite at any moment. All who take refuge in him are happy.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
  My Lord,
</div>


I am set apart, this is true. But set apart by you to you.

I reach out to the world, plead to the world, and with the Spirit, invite the world to come into Your loving embrace.

Few do. Many do not.

How can I respond?

You are my Lord above. You are my King on high. All things, both spiritual and material, are yours. All truth and all philosophies are under your sovereign hand. All lives and minds are under your rightful rulership.

You have set me apart not because of my own goodness but because of the goodness you have given me. You have set me apart and now I am in your safe arms forever. I finally see that you have set me apart in order to keep me safe from your wrath.

Be glorious in my life. Give me courage to proclaim your sweet name. Move me to be more of your of sweet aroma to those being saved and to those perishing.

Amen.
