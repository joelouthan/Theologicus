## The Psalm

>Psalm 34 (CSB)  
><sup>6</sup> This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him and saved him from all his troubles. 

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My everything 
</div>

I lack.
* I am weak.
* I have nothing.
* I am poor.
* I am dead.

Whatever I have is from you.
* This roof upon my head.
* Clothes on my back.
* My warm bed.
* My beautiful wife.
* My wonderful children.
* My running cars.
* My vocation.

All of it comes from you alone.

But I have everything.
* I am wealthy beyond measure.
* I am strong.
* I am the richest.
* I am fully alive.

All of because I am in full possession of your Son Jesus Christ.

He is my rock

He is my fortress

He is my redeemer

He is my strength

He is my beloved

And I am his.

Keep me close to you.
* Do not let me go.
* Do what you must
* to keep me with you.

Amen.
