# Praying Through: Psalm 119:30

## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:30 (CSB) I have chosen the way of truth; I have set your ordinances before me.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

Is this not your blessed holy Son?  
  Is this not the Christ  
  who shed his precious blood for me?

He has set his life down so I can die in him and live in you  
  this was the only way  
  there was no other way.

When he called me  
  when I was lost and dead  
  he called me to repent  
  because he has arrived  
  he called me from death to life.

And because of what he has done  
  I live in you  
  and you are in me  
  forever.
