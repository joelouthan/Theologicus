# Praying Through: Psalm 103 Forgiving

## The Psalm

>Psalm 103 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> My soul, bless the LORD, and all that is within me, bless his holy name. 
>
><sup>2</sup> My soul, bless the LORD, and do not forget all his benefits. 
>
><sup>3</sup> He forgives all your iniquity; he heals all your diseases. 
>
><sup>4</sup> He redeems your life from the Pit; he crowns you with faithful love and compassion. 
>
><sup>5</sup> He satisfies you with good things; your youth is renewed like the eagle. 
>
><sup>6</sup> The LORD executes acts of righteousness and justice for all the oppressed. 
>
><sup>7</sup> He revealed his ways to Moses, his deeds to the people of Israel. 
>
><sup>8</sup> The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in faithful love. 
>
><sup>9</sup> He will not always accuse us or be angry forever. 
>
><sup>10</sup> He has not dealt with us as our sins deserve or repaid us according to our iniquities. 
>
><sup>11</sup> For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his faithful love toward those who fear him. 
>
><sup>12</sup> As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us. 
>
><sup>13</sup> As a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those who fear him. 
>
><sup>14</sup> For he knows what we are made of, remembering that we are dust. 
>
><sup>15</sup> As for man, his days are like grass— he blooms like a flower of the field; 
>
><sup>16</sup> when the wind passes over it, it vanishes, and its place is no longer known. 
>
><sup>17</sup> But from eternity to eternity the LORD’s faithful love is toward those who fear him, and his righteousness toward the grandchildren 
>
><sup>18</sup> of those who keep his covenant, who remember to observe his precepts. 
>
><sup>19</sup> The LORD has established his throne in heaven, and his kingdom rules over all. 
>
><sup>20</sup> Bless the LORD, all his angels of great strength, who do his word, obedient to his command. 
>
><sup>21</sup> Bless the LORD, all his armies, his servants who do his will. 
>
><sup>22</sup> Bless the LORD, all his works in all the places where he rules. My soul, bless the LORD!

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Lord
</div>

So what then can I say?  
So what then can I do?  
All I can do is simply thank you.

So from the bottom of my heart,  
I thank you for giving me strength.

Thank you my Father God.  
Thank you my Christ Jesus.  
Thank you my Holy Spirit.  

You judged me faithful.  
You appointed to Your service.  
Despite my dishonoring and blaspheming,  
Your holy name,  
despite my persecution and hatred  
those who love you,  
despite my perverted and violent opposition  
towards you,  

Still  
I only received mercy  
because I was lost  
I was lame  
I was deaf  
I was blind  
I was stupid  
I was ignorant  
I was evil  
I was dead  
and I was not looking and could not look for you whatsoever.  

But Your beautiful, sweet and tender  
love, mercy and grace  
overflowed for me  
overwhelmingly  
undeservedly  
ill-deservingly  
with your unbroken faithfulness  
and your relentless love  
that can only be by You,  
for You,  
through You,  
my Christ Jesus my Lord my Savior.  

These words  
out of my heart  
are true  
and with all of my hope and dreams  
and desires and wishes  
that these words would be sweet to your ears.  

I know  
that you came in this world  
to rescue your people  
to pull them out of despair  
to give your people life  
to save them from their sins  
to bring them to you  
evil sinners  
at war with you  
All of us  
And I lead this group.  
I am the foremost  
I am their chief  
I am their victor  
I am their champion of those who would face Your terrifying wrath!  

Yet,  
in this reason  
that Your grace abounds all the more  
that Your mercy renews every morning  
that Your love never ceases  
that You  
my Lord and Savior  
Jesus Christ  
might display  

Your perfection, beauty, tenderness, quickness,  
Your love, mercy, grace, patience  
for all of those who You call Yours  
and those would believe upon Your holy name for life forever.  

This is why I will sing  
to my God of the everlasting to the everlasting  
my Triune  
my Father  
my Son  
my Holy Spirit  
my immortal  
my invisible  
my Only One  
my Creator  
my Sustainer  
my Merciful  
my Peace  
my Grace  
my Faith  
my Messiah  
my Immanuel, God with Us  
my Blessed  
my Living Word  
my Christ  
my Son of God  
my Fellow Heir  
my Second Adam  
my Kinsman Redeemer  
my Beginning  
my Means  
my End  
my Majesty  
my Truth  
my Way  
my Life  
my Wisdom  
my Teacher  
my Rescuer  
my Promise  
my Calling  
my Fulfillment  
my Abundance  
my Host  
my Governor  
my High Priest  
my Prophet  
my Apostle  
my Sufferer  
my Messiah  
my Servant  
my Son of Man  
my Glorified  
my Power  
my Gospel  
my Guide  
my Elector  
my All-Sufficient  
my Lion of Judah  
my Worthy Lamb who was slain  
my King of all kings  
my Lord of all lords  
my Commander  
my Ruler above all  
my Name above all Names  
my Wonderful Counselor  
my Mighty God  
my Everlasting Father  
my Prince of Peace  

my Holiness  
my Righteousness  
my Justice  
my Faithfulness  
my Mercy  
my Grace  
my Friend  
my Confidence  
my Pastor  
my Elder  
my Brother  
my Assurance  
my Redeemer  
my Rock  
my Salvation  
my All in all  
my Exalted  
my Glorious  
my Beloved  
my Joy  
my Song  
my Love  

my Jesus Christ, King, Lord, Savior and Messiah  
my Father, my Father, my Abba, my heart  
my Holy Spirit, my comfort, my peace, my gift, my breath.  

So I will be so very careful to  
worship,  
sing,  
praise,  
glorify,  
exalt,  
proclaim,  
honor,  
dedicate,  
and love  
You alone.  

I pray this desperately and joyfully,  
in the beautiful,  
sweet,  
precious,  
most tender,  
loveliest,  
most worthy,  
dearest name of  
Your Son.  

His name is  
the Lord Jesus Christ.  

And with every bit of my soul
body
strength
mind
heart

I will praise and bless your holy name
forever

I cannot believe that you would be so mindful of me.

You have seen me in the fallen state
  and you took pity on me.

You know that I could not save myself 
  and I was good as dead.

I was once foolish and led astray
  enslaved by my sin and my desires.

But you sent your Son
  to come rescue me
  to save me from death
  to capture me
  and make me yours.

You are the lover of my soul
  and the king of my heart.

You are my portion and my rock
  forever.

I make no claim to myself
  I am yours.

Be glorified today.

My sins have been massive
  there is none that have out-sinned me
  for anger, I took joy in rage
  for lust, I have consumed all perversion
  for lying, every word out of my mouth was deceit.

But worst of all
  I pretend to be nice and kind
  but inside, I was the opposite
  and thought I had everyone fooled
  because if people knew the real person
  the one in my mind and heart
  they would not like me
  and they would despise me
  and have nothing to do with me.

And I have lost friends
  and loved ones
  because of who I really was

But you knew me
  you saw straight through me
  and in my cold heart
  was the root of evil
  that continuously thought evil thoughts
  always

But you love me
  and you excavated my old heart
  and gave me yours
  sealed me with your Spirit
  renewed my mind
  opened my eyes
  and my ears
  and unmute my tongue

And the infection
  the cancer
  the disease
  that was eating my soul?
  Your purged it
  cleansed me
  and made me a completely new person.

For all of my
  troubling sin
  wicked perversion
  grotesque behavior
  slothfulness
  anger
  I should have perish
  I should be under the wrath of your Son
  I should have been counted with the worthless

I should have
  because everything about me
  was at war with you

But you have been my God
  before I was even a thought in my mother's womb
  you have molded time and space
  and your Son entered into creation
  to save a wretched outcast like me

You have delivered me from sin
  and you have removed my transgressions
  but you have not gone back in time
  and removed the hurt I have caused
  and the hurt and pain that I have endured

You alone
  have made it worthwhile
  the evil I have felt and dealt
  you have turned it into good
  because your Son died on the cross
  to reconcile creation to himself
  for good.

I praise you
  because you alone
  have loved me.

You have made me a blessed man
  I am wealthy than the wealthiest combined
  I am stronger than a thousand strongmen
  I am wiser than Solomon

Because I have you
  you are my King Jesus
  you are my everything
  everything in this life
  if I have a little or a lot
  I have it all
  because you are my portion and my lot

  If I am weak or I am strong
  I have it all
  because you are the Almighty

  If I am insane or brilliant
  I have all wisdom
  because you give without hesitation

In you, my Christ
  my Father has given me so much
  that heaven and earth
  could give me 
  no more.

No matter what sin
  and evil is against me
  you are always
  my Lord and my God
  forever

There is no wickedness left
  on this world
  by mankind
  that can rail against me
  because I have you alone
  forever

But it is not the trespasses of the world
  that will cause me to fall away
  it is my own depravity
  that will cause me to wander

But you have given me
  your Son's righteousness
  and now
  you are my hope and stay.
  I have you
  because
  you have me
  forever

Be exalted, O Lord
  in my life
  today

There was a time
  when I thought I knew of your word
  because I glanced through the pages
  or I took a couple weeks of intently reading
  and then crown myself
  an expert on what you have said

But I was foolish
  and always disobedient
  to what you have told me to do

But if my eyes were opened
  and my ears were unstopped
  and my heart was soft
  and my mind was renewed
  and my soul alive
  and your Spirit was in me

Then I would have heard one word
  from your lips
  and been transformed
  and been made whole
  and would have believed.

And I would have known
  your sweetest mercies
  your whelming grace
  your unending love
  and your kindness
  and forgiveness
  for my wrongdoings

But now I know
  and you are
  and I am yours
  and you are mine
  forever.

I bear witness
  with my entire life
  with my heart
  that you are this kind
  and this merciful
  and this gracious
  and this loving 
  to a wretch like me

Look at my sins!
  they are too numerous to count
  they are too vile to mention
  they are too great to be forgiven
  they are cause for your great wrath

I was the chief of sinners
  and done more evil in your sight
  than anybody could imagine

But you came to me
  you shown mercy to me
  and you lifted me up
  out of death
  and into life
  and into your presence
  and into your family
  and into your kingdom
  and into your glory
  forever.

You have always been kind
  and compassionate
  and merciful
  and good to me.

I praise you
  you are my God.

I have spent my entire life
  warring against you
  fighting you
  sinning against you
  ignoring you
  pretending to be good
  when I was corrupted
  to the core

With all of my life
  I have sinned against you
  lied to my fellow man
  lusted after women
  and anger towards children

I was an walking abomination
  and a living idol maker
  and a friend to Satan
  and a servant to the world
  and a slave to my own desires

I was a blasphemer
  persecutor
  arrogant
  violent man
  towards you

I was foolish
  disobedient
  deceived
  enslaved by various passions and pleasures
  living in malice and envy
  hateful
  detesting every one else

I was dead in my trespasses and sins
  and walked according to the ways of this world
  and was ruled by the ruler of the power of the air
  my spirit working in the disobedience
  lived with my own fleshly desires
  carrying out the inclinations of my flesh and thoughts
  and by born nature
  rightfully
  a child of wrath

I have made it my livelihood
  to resist your grace

But what was your response?

You did not destroy me
  you did not cast me to hell
  you did not leave me to my own corruption

Instead
  you were kind to me
  you sent your Son
  my Savior
  my Redeemer
  because you love me
  you saved me 
  the opposite of everything I have ever done
  and you were merciful to me
  you washed me clean
  you made me new
  you gave me your Spirit
  you justified me
  you gave me grace
  you made me a co-heir
  you gave me hope
  you gave me eternal life

Instead
  you strengthen me
  you consider me faithful
  you appoint me to the ministry
  you give me mercy
  you give me more grace
  you give me more faith
  you give me more love
  you give me more hope
  you saved me
  a sinner
  the worst of them
  and you give me more mercy
  so that in me
  as the worst of them
  you might demonstrate your extraordinary patience
  as an example to those who would believe in you
  for eternal life

Instead
  you were rich in mercy to me
  you were great in love to me
  you made me alive with Christ
  even though I was dead in sin
  you saved me by grace
  you raised me up with Christ
  you seated me with Christ in the heavens
  so that in the coming ages
  you might display the immeasurable riches of your grace
  through your kindness to me in Christ Jesus
  for you gave me salvation
  for you gave me grace
  for you gave me faith
  you made me your poem
  your masterpiece
  your workmanship

Instead
  you shown me the path of life
  you gave me the fullness of joy
  you gave me pleasures forevermore

Because you have given
  your only begotten Son
  Jesus Christ
  my Lord
  Son of God
  who is God

This is why
  I will proclaim
  I will sing
  I will praise
  I will boast
  you are the King of ages
  you are immortal
  you are invisible
  you are the only God
  you are worthy of honor
  you are worthy of glory
  you are worthy of praise
  you are worthy of adoration
  you are worthy of worship
  forever and ever

My sins
  deserve the worst of your wrath
  the deepest hells
  the worst consequences

And I had suffered 
  through my own sins
  here on my earth

In your great holiness
  you could have left me to rot
  you could have hardened my heart
  fashioned me into a vessel of wrath
  prepared me for destruction
  and left me to my own devices
  and died
  and judged me forever
  and hated me forever

I was the worst sinner
  the chief of treason

In no ways
  did I do one thing
  to get you to notice me
  to get you to love me
  and care for me
  to give me grace
  to grant me mercy

But
  because you are rich in mercy
  you lavish me with grace upon grace
  and you love me
  you saw my condition
  and you knew I was going to die
  That is why
  you sent your Son
  to snatch from the pit of hell
  and sit me at your dinner table
  forever and ever

Who is like, Lord?
  And who can compare to you?
  You alone are worthy.

You are high
  far above the earth
  you alone are exalted
  far above
  all of my idols

But infinite distance
  that you are from me
  because of my sin
  and wickedness
  and trespasses
  and iniquities
  and the thoughts
  that are in my mind
  and the pull
  in my heart
  continually
  to pull away from you
  and do evil consistently

But that infinite measurement
  is the exact amount
  of your faithful love
  towards me

How do I know?
  You sent your Son
  and he traveled the distance
  and he bridges the gap
  so that I will be saved by you
  adopted by you
  loved by you
  and be with you
  forever

My Lord
  you are high
  above all the earth
  you are exalted
  far above
  all of my gods

And I will worship you
I will exalt you
I will love you

And with everything
  within me
  I will praise
  your glorious name
  forever
  and 
  ever

My mind and heart and soul are continually filled and constantly abounding in sin--every source of my being is filled with wickedness towards you.

I see that Christ, in his divinity and humanity, is perfect towards you.

But I know you dwell in me and yet, my flesh still wages war against you.

But look at what you have told me:

>I have *infinitely* removed your transgressions from you.

All of this crap in me? You have removed every bit of my crap *eternally* from me.

I know this because your Son died and bleed for me.

I will always praise your glorious name!

I have one thing to say

I see my love and my affections
  swell for you
  and all I want more 
  than anything
  is to see your face
  and be with you.

This
  that you have done in me
  could only be you
  thank you
  my God.

For all of my sins
  and my wickedness
  and my evil
  my pride
  my hubris
  my arrogance
  my lust
  my selfishness
  my self-centeredness
  my anger
  my wrath
  my hatred
  my bitterness
  my resentment
  my jealousy
  my envy
  my greed
  my gluttony
  my sloth
  my laziness
  my apathy
  my indifference
  my lack of love
  my lack of compassion
  my lack of mercy
  my lack of grace
  my lack of forgiveness
  my lack of kindness
  my lack of gentleness
  my lack of self-control
  my lack of faith
  my lack of hope
  my lack of joy
  my lack of peace
  my lack of patience
  my lack of goodness

My ultimate failings

You know this about me
  and yet you love me
  and you sent your Son
  to live and die for me
  so that I might die and live with you
  forever

In my life
  be glorified
  today.

I am not here for long at all. 

And I wish I had loved you all of my life. 

But I know I will love you for the rest of my life. 

Come get me soon. 

I love you.

Once invisible now revealed  
  from faith to faith
  
And when you appeared  
  you saved me

You plucked me out of time and death  
 And entered me into your precious joy
  
Forever and ever

I have never kept your covenant
  I have never observed your precepts
  I have tried and failed
  I struggle and continue to fail
  I have fallen all the way short of your glory

But this covenant you have made
  you have made with not with me
  but for me
  and you made this promise
  with the only one who could keep it
  your only begotten Son
  Jesus Christ
  Son of God who is God
  forever past and forever future

You keep us
  because he alone has fulfilled the covenant
  he alone has kept the precepts
  and I am in him
  and he is in me
  forever

Blessed be your holy name forever and ever

For all of my days  
  I will bless your name  
  Lord God my Father  
  from everlasting to everlasting.

Yours alone  
  is the greatness  
  and the power  
  and the glory  
  and the victory  
  and the majesty  
  for everything that exists  
  in the heaven  
  in the earth  
  and under the earth  
  is yours.

Yours is the kingdom  
  and you are exalted  
  far above  
  all other gods.

Whatever provision  
  and riches  
  and honor  
  and glory  
  that I am might hold  
  has come completely  
  and totally  
  from you alone.

Any ounce of power  
  and strength  
  and might  
  and grace  
  that I think I have  
  is from your hand  
  you alone make great  
  and give strength to all.

Because you are God alone  
  I thank you  
  and I praise your  
  glorious name  
  forever.

Who am I  
  and what are these people  
  who think we can give something to you  
  when you do not need anything  
  and you are not served by our hands and strength.

For everything  
  comes from you alone  
  and we are only giving  
  what you have given us.

We pilgrims  
  and aliens  
  sojourning  
  and wandering  
  through this earth  
  just like all of our forefathers before us  
  Our days here  
  are like a shadow  
  and we are desperately  
  without hope.

I know you  
  you have seen me  
  from eternity past  
  and found me wanting  
  and dead  
  and running from you  
  and you are only pleased  
  with what is right  
  so you have sent your Son  
  to live so I could die  
  and to die so that I can live  
  and to live again so I can be with you  
  and to ascend so I can be in his charge  
  for all of my days  
  with you.

Lord God  
  of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,  
  my fathers,   
  make your home in me  
  and your Spirit to dwell in me  
  because Christ lives in me  
  and bring me  
  all the way home.

For yours alone  
  is the kingdom  
  and the power  
  and the glory  
  forever and ever.

Amen
