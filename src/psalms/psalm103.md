# Praying Through: Psalm 103 Forgiving

## The Psalm

>Psalm 103  
><sup>1</sup> My soul, bless the LORD, and all that is within me, bless his holy name. 
>
><sup>2</sup> My soul, bless the LORD, and do not forget all his benefits. 
>
><sup>3</sup> He forgives all your iniquity; he heals all your diseases. 
>
><sup>4</sup> He redeems your life from the Pit; he crowns you with faithful love and compassion. 
>
><sup>5</sup> He satisfies you with good things; your youth is renewed like the eagle. 
>
><sup>6</sup> The LORD executes acts of righteousness and justice for all the oppressed. 
>
><sup>7</sup> He revealed his ways to Moses, his deeds to the people of Israel. 
>
><sup>8</sup> The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in faithful love. 
>
><sup>9</sup> He will not always accuse us or be angry forever. 
>
><sup>10</sup> He has not dealt with us as our sins deserve or repaid us according to our iniquities. 
>
><sup>11</sup> For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his faithful love toward those who fear him. 
>
><sup>12</sup> As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us. 
>
><sup>13</sup> As a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those who fear him. 
>
><sup>14</sup> For he knows what we are made of, remembering that we are dust. 
>
><sup>15</sup> As for man, his days are like grass— he blooms like a flower of the field; 
>
><sup>16</sup> when the wind passes over it, it vanishes, and its place is no longer known. 
>
><sup>17</sup> But from eternity to eternity the LORD’s faithful love is toward those who fear him, and his righteousness toward the grandchildren 
>
><sup>18</sup> of those who keep his covenant, who remember to observe his precepts. 
>
><sup>19</sup> The LORD has established his throne in heaven, and his kingdom rules over all. 
>
><sup>20</sup> Bless the LORD, all his angels of great strength, who do his word, obedient to his command. 
>
><sup>21</sup> Bless the LORD, all his armies, his servants who do his will. 
>
><sup>22</sup> Bless the LORD, all his works in all the places where he rules. My soul, bless the LORD!

## The Prayer.

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Lord  
</div>

So what then can I say?  
So what then can I do?  
All I can do is simply thank you.

So from the bottom of my heart,  
I thank you for giving me strength.

Thank you my Father God.  
Thank you my Christ Jesus.  
Thank you my Holy Spirit.  

You judged me faithful.  
You appointed to Your service.  
Despite my dishonoring and blaspheming,  
Your holy name,  
despite my persecution and hatred  
those who love you,  
despite my perverted and violent opposition  
towards you,  

Still  
I only received mercy  
because I was lost  
I was lame  
I was deaf  
I was blind  
I was stupid  
I was ignorant  
I was evil  
I was dead  
and I was not looking and could not look for you whatsoever.  

But Your beautiful, sweet and tender  
love, mercy and grace  
overflowed for me  
overwhelmingly  
undeservedly  
ill-deservingly  
with your unbroken faithfulness  
and your relentless love  
that can only be by You,  
for You,  
through You,  
my Christ Jesus my Lord my Savior.  

These words  
out of my heart  
are true  
and with all of my hope and dreams  
and desires and wishes  
that these words would be sweet to your ears.  

I know  
that you came in this world  
to rescue your people  
to pull them out of despair  
to give your people life  
to save them from their sins  
to bring them to you  
evil sinners  
at war with you  
All of us  
And I lead this group.  
I am the foremost  
I am their chief  
I am their victor  
I am their champion of those who would face Your terrifying wrath!  

Yet,  
in this reason  
that Your grace abounds all the more  
that Your mercy renews every morning  
that Your love never ceases  
that You  
my Lord and Savior  
Jesus Christ  
might display  

Your perfection, beauty, tenderness, quickness,  
Your love, mercy, grace, patience  
for all of those who You call Yours  
and those would believe upon Your holy name for life forever.  

This is why I will sing  
to my God of the everlasting to the everlasting  
my Triune  
my Father  
my Son  
my Holy Spirit  
my immortal  
my invisible  
my Only One  
my Creator  
my Sustainer  
my Merciful  
my Peace  
my Grace  
my Faith  
my Messiah  
my Immanuel, God with Us  
my Blessed  
my Living Word  
my Christ  
my Son of God  
my Fellow Heir  
my Second Adam  
my Kinsman Redeemer  
my Beginning  
my Means  
my End  
my Majesty  
my Truth  
my Way  
my Life  
my Wisdom  
my Teacher  
my Rescuer  
my Promise  
my Calling  
my Fulfillment  
my Abundance  
my Host  
my Governor  
my High Priest  
my Prophet  
my Apostle  
my Sufferer  
my Messiah  
my Servant  
my Son of Man  
my Glorified  
my Power  
my Gospel  
my Guide  
my Elector  
my All-Sufficient  
my Lion of Judah  
my Worthy Lamb who was slain  
my King of all kings  
my Lord of all lords  
my Commander  
my Ruler above all  
my Name above all Names  
my Wonderful Counselor  
my Mighty God  
my Everlasting Father  
my Prince of Peace  

my Holiness  
my Righteousness  
my Justice  
my Faithfulness  
my Mercy  
my Grace  
my Friend  
my Confidence  
my Pastor  
my Elder  
my Brother  
my Assurance  
my Redeemer  
my Rock  
my Salvation  
my All in all  
my Exalted  
my Glorious  
my Beloved  
my Joy  
my Song  
my Love  

my Jesus Christ, King, Lord, Savior and Messiah  
my Father, my Father, my Abba, my heart  
my Holy Spirit, my comfort, my peace, my gift, my breath.  

So I will be so very careful to  
worship,  
sing,  
praise,  
glorify,  
exalt,  
proclaim,  
honor,  
dedicate,  
and love  
You alone.  

I pray this desperately and joyfully,  
in the beautiful,  
sweet,  
precious,  
most tender,  
loveliest,  
most worthy,  
dearest name of  
Your Son.  

His name is  
the Lord Jesus Christ.  

And with every bit of my soul  
body  
strength  
mind  
heart.

I will praise and bless your holy name  
forever.

I cannot believe that you would be so mindful of me.

You have seen me in the fallen state  
* and you took pity on me.

You know that I could not save myself 
* and I was good as dead.

I was once foolish and led astray  
* enslaved by my sin and my desires.

But you sent your Son  
* to come rescue me  
* to save me from death  
* to capture me  
* and make me yours.

You are the lover of my soul  
* and the king of my heart.

You are my portion and my rock  
* forever.

I make no claim to myself  
* I am yours.

Be glorified today.

My sins have been massive  
* there is none that have out-sinned me  
* for anger, I took joy in rage  
* for lust, I have consumed all perversion  
* for lying, every word out of my mouth was deceit.

But worst of all  
* I pretend to be nice and kind  
* but inside, I was the opposite  
* and thought I had everyone fooled  
* because if people knew the real person  
* the one in my mind and heart  
* they would not like me  
* and they would despise me  
* and have nothing to do with me.

And I have lost friends  
* and loved ones  
* because of who I really was.

But you knew me  
* you saw straight through me  
* and in my cold heart  
* was the root of evil  
* that continuously thought evil thoughts  
* always.

But you love me  
* and you excavated my old heart  
* and gave me yours  
* sealed me with your Spirit  
* renewed my mind  
* opened my eyes  
* and my ears  
* and unmute my tongue.

And the infection  
* the cancer  
* the disease  
* that was eating my soul?
* Your purged it  
* cleansed me  
* and made me a completely new person.

For all of my  
* troubling sin  
* wicked perversion  
* grotesque behavior  
* slothfulness  
* anger  
* I should have perish  
* I should be under the wrath of your Son  
* I should have been counted with the worthless.

I should have  
* because everything about me  
* was at war with you.

But you have been my God  
* before I was even a thought in my mother's womb  
* you have molded time and space  
* and your Son entered into creation  
* to save a wretched outcast like me.

You have delivered me from sin  
* and you have removed my transgressions  
* but you have not gone back in time  
* and removed the hurt I have caused  
* and the hurt and pain that I have endured.

You alone  
* have made it worthwhile  
* the evil I have felt and dealt  
* you have turned it into good  
* because your Son died on the cross  
* to reconcile creation to himself  
* for good.

I praise you  
* because you alone  
* have loved me.

You have made me a blessed man  
* I am wealthy than the wealthiest combined  
* I am stronger than a thousand strongmen  
* I am wiser than Solomon.

Because I have you  
* you are my King Jesus  
* you are my everything  
* everything in this life  
* if I have a little or a lot  
* I have it all  
* because you are my portion and my lot.

* If I am weak or I am strong  
* I have it all  
* because you are the Almighty.

* If I am insane or brilliant  
* I have all wisdom  
* because you give without hesitation.

In you, my Christ  
* my Father has given me so much  
* that heaven and earth  
* could give me 
* no more.

No matter what sin  
* and evil is against me  
* you are always  
* my Lord and my God  
* forever.

There is no wickedness left  
* on this world  
* by mankind  
* that can rail against me  
* because I have you alone  
* forever.

But it is not the trespasses of the world  
* that will cause me to fall away  
* it is my own depravity  
* that will cause me to wander.

But you have given me  
* your Son's righteousness  
* and now  
* you are my hope and stay.
* I have you  
* because  
* you have me  
* forever.

Be exalted, O Lord  
* in my life  
* today.

There was a time  
* when I thought I knew of your word  
* because I glanced through the pages  
* or I took a couple weeks of intently reading  
* and then crown myself  
* an expert on what you have said.

But I was foolish  
* and always disobedient  
* to what you have told me to do.

But if my eyes were opened  
* and my ears were unstopped  
* and my heart was soft  
* and my mind was renewed  
* and my soul alive  
* and your Spirit was in me.

Then I would have heard one word  
* from your lips  
* and been transformed  
* and been made whole  
* and would have believed.

And I would have known  
* your sweetest mercies  
* your whelming grace  
* your unending love  
* and your kindness  
* and forgiveness  
* for my wrongdoings.

But now I know  
* and you are  
* and I am yours  
* and you are mine  
* forever.

I bear witness  
* with my entire life  
* with my heart  
* that you are this kind  
* and this merciful  
* and this gracious  
* and this loving 
* to a wretch like me.

Look at my sins!
* they are too numerous to count  
* they are too vile to mention  
* they are too great to be forgiven  
* they are cause for your great wrath.

I was the chief of sinners  
* and done more evil in your sight  
* than anybody could imagine.

But you came to me  
* you shown mercy to me  
* and you lifted me up  
* out of death  
* and into life  
* and into your presence  
* and into your family  
* and into your kingdom  
* and into your glory  
* forever.

You have always been kind  
* and compassionate  
* and merciful  
* and good to me.

I praise you  
* you are my God.

I have spent my entire life  
* warring against you  
* fighting you  
* sinning against you  
* ignoring you  
* pretending to be good  
* when I was corrupted  
* to the core.

With all of my life  
* I have sinned against you  
* lied to my fellow man  
* lusted after women  
* and anger towards children.

I was an walking abomination  
* and a living idol maker  
* and a friend to Satan  
* and a servant to the world  
* and a slave to my own desires.

I was a blasphemer  
* persecutor  
* arrogant  
* violent man  
* towards you.

I was foolish  
* disobedient  
* deceived  
* enslaved by various passions and pleasures  
* living in malice and envy  
* hateful  
* detesting every one else.

I was dead in my trespasses and sins  
* and walked according to the ways of this world  
* and was ruled by the ruler of the power of the air  
* my spirit working in the disobedience  
* lived with my own fleshly desires  
* carrying out the inclinations of my flesh and thoughts  
* and by born nature  
* rightfully  
* a child of wrath.

I have made it my livelihood  
* to resist your grace.

But what was your response?

You did not destroy me  
* you did not cast me to hell  
* you did not leave me to my own corruption.

Instead  
* you were kind to me  
* you sent your Son  
* my Savior  
* my Redeemer  
* because you love me  
* you saved me 
* the opposite of everything I have ever done  
* and you were merciful to me  
* you washed me clean  
* you made me new  
* you gave me your Spirit  
* you justified me  
* you gave me grace  
* you made me a co-heir  
* you gave me hope  
* you gave me eternal life.

Instead  
* you strengthen me  
* you consider me faithful  
* you appoint me to the ministry  
* you give me mercy  
* you give me more grace  
* you give me more faith  
* you give me more love  
* you give me more hope  
* you saved me  
* a sinner  
* the worst of them  
* and you give me more mercy  
* so that in me  
* as the worst of them  
* you might demonstrate your extraordinary patience  
* as an example to those who would believe in you  
* for eternal life.

Instead  
* you were rich in mercy to me  
* you were great in love to me  
* you made me alive with Christ  
* even though I was dead in sin  
* you saved me by grace  
* you raised me up with Christ  
* you seated me with Christ in the heavens  
* so that in the coming ages  
* you might display the immeasurable riches of your grace  
* through your kindness to me in Christ Jesus  
* for you gave me salvation  
* for you gave me grace  
* for you gave me faith  
* you made me your poem  
* your masterpiece  
* your workmanship.

Instead  
* you shown me the path of life  
* you gave me the fullness of joy  
* you gave me pleasures forevermore.

Because you have given  
* your only begotten Son  
* Jesus Christ  
* my Lord  
* Son of God  
* who is God.

This is why  
* I will proclaim  
* I will sing  
* I will praise  
* I will boast  
* you are the King of ages  
* you are immortal  
* you are invisible  
* you are the only God  
* you are worthy of honor  
* you are worthy of glory  
* you are worthy of praise  
* you are worthy of adoration  
* you are worthy of worship  
* forever and ever.

My sins  
* deserve the worst of your wrath  
* the deepest hells  
* the worst consequences.

And I had suffered 
* through my own sins  
* here on my earth.

In your great holiness  
* you could have left me to rot  
* you could have hardened my heart  
* fashioned me into a vessel of wrath  
* prepared me for destruction  
* and left me to my own devices  
* and died  
* and judged me forever  
* and hated me forever.

I was the worst sinner  
* the chief of treason.

In no ways  
* did I do one thing  
* to get you to notice me  
* to get you to love me  
* and care for me  
* to give me grace  
* to grant me mercy.

But  
* because you are rich in mercy  
* you lavish me with grace upon grace  
* and you love me  
* you saw my condition  
* and you knew I was going to die  
* That is why  
* you sent your Son  
* to snatch from the pit of hell  
* and sit me at your dinner table  
* forever and ever.

Who is like, Lord?
* And who can compare to you?
* You alone are worthy.

You are high  
* far above the earth  
* you alone are exalted  
* far above  
* all of my idols.

But infinite distance  
* that you are from me  
* because of my sin  
* and wickedness  
* and trespasses  
* and iniquities  
* and the thoughts  
* that are in my mind  
* and the pull  
* in my heart  
* continually  
* to pull away from you  
* and do evil consistently.

But that infinite measurement  
* is the exact amount  
* of your faithful love  
* towards me.

How do I know?
* You sent your Son  
* and he traveled the distance  
* and he bridges the gap  
* so that I will be saved by you  
* adopted by you  
* loved by you  
* and be with you  
* forever.

My Lord  
* you are high  
* above all the earth  
* you are exalted  
* far above  
* all of my gods.

And I will worship you  
I will exalt you  
I will love you.

And with everything  
* within me  
* I will praise  
* your glorious name  
* forever  
* and 
* ever.

My mind and heart and soul are continually filled and constantly abounding in sin--every source of my being is filled with wickedness towards you.

I see that Christ, in his divinity and humanity, is perfect towards you.

But I know you dwell in me and yet, my flesh still wages war against you.

But look at what you have told me:

>I have *infinitely* removed your transgressions from you.

All of this crap in me? You have removed every bit of my crap *eternally* from me.

I know this because your Son died and bleed for me.

I will always praise your glorious name!

I have one thing to say.

I see my love and my affections  
* swell for you  
* and all I want more 
* than anything  
* is to see your face  
* and be with you.

This  
* that you have done in me  
* could only be you  
* thank you  
* my God.

For all of my sins  
* and my wickedness  
* and my evil  
* my pride  
* my hubris  
* my arrogance  
* my lust  
* my selfishness  
* my self-centeredness  
* my anger  
* my wrath  
* my hatred  
* my bitterness  
* my resentment  
* my jealousy  
* my envy  
* my greed  
* my gluttony  
* my sloth  
* my laziness  
* my apathy  
* my indifference  
* my lack of love  
* my lack of compassion  
* my lack of mercy  
* my lack of grace  
* my lack of forgiveness  
* my lack of kindness  
* my lack of gentleness  
* my lack of self-control  
* my lack of faith  
* my lack of hope  
* my lack of joy  
* my lack of peace  
* my lack of patience  
* my lack of goodness.

My ultimate failings.

You know this about me  
* and yet you love me  
* and you sent your Son  
* to live and die for me  
* so that I might die and live with you  
* forever.

In my life  
* be glorified  
* today.

I am not here for long at all. 

And I wish I had loved you all of my life. 

But I know I will love you for the rest of my life. 

Come get me soon. 

I love you.

Once invisible now revealed  
* from faith to faith.
* 
And when you appeared  
* you saved me.

You plucked me out of time and death  
 And entered me into your precious joy.
* 
Forever and ever.

I have never kept your covenant  
* I have never observed your precepts  
* I have tried and failed  
* I struggle and continue to fail  
* I have fallen all the way short of your glory.

But this covenant you have made  
* you have made with not with me  
* but for me  
* and you made this promise  
* with the only one who could keep it  
* your only begotten Son  
* Jesus Christ  
* Son of God who is God  
* forever past and forever future.

You keep us  
* because he alone has fulfilled the covenant  
* he alone has kept the precepts  
* and I am in him  
* and he is in me  
* forever.

Blessed be your holy name forever and ever.

For all of my days  
* I will bless your name  
* Lord God my Father  
* from everlasting to everlasting.

Yours alone  
* is the greatness  
* and the power  
* and the glory  
* and the victory  
* and the majesty  
* for everything that exists  
* in the heaven  
* in the earth  
* and under the earth  
* is yours.

Yours is the kingdom  
* and you are exalted  
* far above  
* all other gods.

Whatever provision  
* and riches  
* and honor  
* and glory  
* that I am might hold  
* has come completely  
* and totally  
* from you alone.

Any ounce of power  
* and strength  
* and might  
* and grace  
* that I think I have  
* is from your hand  
* you alone make great  
* and give strength to all.

Because you are God alone  
* I thank you  
* and I praise your  
* glorious name  
* forever.

Who am I  
* and what are these people  
* who think we can give something to you  
* when you do not need anything  
* and you are not served by our hands and strength.

For everything  
* comes from you alone  
* and we are only giving  
* what you have given us.

We pilgrims  
* and aliens  
* sojourning  
* and wandering  
* through this earth  
* just like all of our forefathers before us  
* Our days here  
* are like a shadow  
* and we are desperately  
* without hope.

I know you  
* you have seen me  
* from eternity past  
* and found me wanting  
* and dead  
* and running from you  
* and you are only pleased  
* with what is right  
* so you have sent your Son  
* to live so I could die  
* and to die so that I can live  
* and to live again so I can be with you  
* and to ascend so I can be in his charge  
* for all of my days  
* with you.

Lord God  
* of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,  
* my fathers,   
* make your home in me  
* and your Spirit to dwell in me  
* because Christ lives in me  
* and bring me  
* all the way home.

For yours alone  
* is the kingdom  
* and the power  
* and the glory  
* forever and ever.

Amen
