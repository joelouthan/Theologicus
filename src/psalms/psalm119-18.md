## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:18 (CSB) Open my eyes so that I may contemplate wondrous things from your instruction.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

You, my Christ  
* condescend to me  
* walk to me  
* kneel before me  
* speak to me  
* do the perfect work for me  
* touch my eyes  
* and open them  
* in order for me to see the kingdom of God.

If you had not  
* I would be lost and damned into hell  
* forever.

But you have me  
* and now I love you.

Be glorified today.

Amen.
