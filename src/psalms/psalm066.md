# Praying Through: Psalm 66

## The Psalm

>Psalm 66 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director. A song. A psalm. 
>
><sup>1</sup> Let the whole earth shout joyfully to God! 
>
><sup>2</sup> Sing about the glory of his name; make his praise glorious. 
>
><sup>3</sup> Say to God, “How awe-inspiring are your works! Your enemies will cringe before you because of your great strength. 
>
><sup>4</sup> The whole earth will worship you and sing praise to you. They will sing praise to your name.” Selah 
>
><sup>5</sup> Come and see the wonders of God; his acts for humanity are awe-inspiring. 
>
><sup>6</sup> He turned the sea into dry land, and they crossed the river on foot. There we rejoiced in him. 
>
><sup>7</sup> He rules forever by his might; he keeps his eye on the nations. The rebellious should not exalt themselves. Selah 
>
><sup>8</sup> Bless our God, you peoples; let the sound of his praise be heard. 
>
><sup>9</sup> He keeps us alive and does not allow our feet to slip. 
>
><sup>10</sup> For you, God, tested us; you refined us as silver is refined. 
>
><sup>11</sup> You lured us into a trap; you placed burdens on our backs. 
>
><sup>12</sup> You let men ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, but you brought us out to abundance. 
>
><sup>13</sup> I will enter your house with burnt offerings; I will pay you my vows 
>
><sup>14</sup> that my lips promised and my mouth spoke during my distress. 
>
><sup>15</sup> I will offer you fattened sheep as burnt offerings, with the fragrant smoke of rams; I will sacrifice bulls with goats. Selah 
>
><sup>16</sup> Come and listen, all who fear God, and I will tell what he has done for me. 
>
><sup>17</sup> I cried out to him with my mouth, and praise was on my tongue. 
>
><sup>18</sup> If I had been aware of malice in my heart, the Lord would not have listened. 
>
><sup>19</sup> However, God has listened; he has paid attention to the sound of my prayer. 
>
><sup>20</sup> Blessed be God! He has not turned away my prayer or turned his faithful love from me.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Worthy Are You to Be Praised
</div>

Who alone
* who saves the helpless and the weak
* the far and the lost
* the powerless and the downtrodden
* the slave and the oppressed
* the wicked and the sinful
* the blind and the deaf
* the mute and the dumb

But who Lord
* when I was oppose to your will
* when my every breath commit treason against your holiness
* when my every thought was dipped in wickedness and sin
* when my every heartbeat longed to be my own god

But who Lord
* saw me in my wickedness
* in my deceit
* in my folly
* in my stupidness
* in my ignorance
* in my sin
* and had the deepest affection for me.

Nothing stopped you
* you set your love on me
* you sent your Son after me
* you gave your Spirit to seal me
* your grace keeps me
* your mercy secures me
* your righteousness is mine.

There is none like you
* because you are the only God
* who saves.

Amen.
