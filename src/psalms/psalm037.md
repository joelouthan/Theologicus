# Psalm 37

>Of David. 
>
><sup>1</sup> Do not be agitated by evildoers; do not envy those who do wrong. 
>
><sup>2</sup> For they wither quickly like grass and wilt like tender green plants. 
>
><sup>3</sup> Trust in the LORD and do what is good; dwell in the land and live securely. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Take delight in the LORD, and he will give you your heart’s desires. 
>
><sup>5</sup> Commit your way to the LORD; trust in him, and he will act, 
>
><sup>6</sup> making your righteousness shine like the dawn, your justice like the noonday. 
>
><sup>7</sup> Be silent before the LORD and wait expectantly for him; do not be agitated by one who prospers in his way, by the person who carries out evil plans. 
>
><sup>8</sup> Refrain from anger and give up your rage; do not be agitated—it can only bring harm. 
>
><sup>9</sup> For evildoers will be destroyed, but those who put their hope in the LORD will inherit the land. 
>
><sup>10</sup> A little while, and the wicked person will be no more; though you look for him, he will not be there. 
>
><sup>11</sup> But the humble will inherit the land and will enjoy abundant prosperity. 
>
><sup>12</sup> The wicked person schemes against the righteous and gnashes his teeth at him. 
>
><sup>13</sup> The Lord laughs at him because he sees that his day is coming. 
>
><sup>14</sup> The wicked have drawn the sword and strung the bow to bring down the poor and needy and to slaughter those whose way is upright. 
>
><sup>15</sup> Their swords will enter their own hearts, and their bows will be broken. 
>
><sup>16</sup> The little that the righteous person has is better than the abundance of many wicked people. 
>
><sup>17</sup> For the arms of the wicked will be broken, but the LORD supports the righteous. 
>
><sup>18</sup> The LORD watches over the blameless all their days, and their inheritance will last forever. 
>
><sup>19</sup> They will not be disgraced in times of adversity; they will be satisfied in days of hunger. 
>
><sup>20</sup> But the wicked will perish; the LORD’s enemies, like the glory of the pastures, will fade away— they will fade away like smoke. 
>
><sup>21</sup> The wicked person borrows and does not repay, but the righteous one is gracious and giving. 
>
><sup>22</sup> Those who are blessed by the LORD will inherit the land, but those cursed by him will be destroyed. 
>
><sup>23</sup> A person’s steps are established by the LORD, and he takes pleasure in his way. 
>
><sup>24</sup> Though he falls, he will not be overwhelmed, because the LORD supports him with his hand. 
>
><sup>25</sup> I have been young and now I am old, yet I have not seen the righteous abandoned or his children begging for bread. 
>
><sup>26</sup> He is always generous, always lending, and his children are a blessing. 
>
><sup>27</sup> Turn away from evil, do what is good, and settle permanently. 
>
><sup>28</sup> For the LORD loves justice and will not abandon his faithful ones. They are kept safe forever, but the children of the wicked will be destroyed. 
>
><sup>29</sup> The righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it permanently. 
>
><sup>30</sup> The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom; his tongue speaks what is just. 
>
><sup>31</sup> The instruction of his God is in his heart; his steps do not falter. 
>
><sup>32</sup> The wicked one lies in wait for the righteous and intends to kill him; 
>
><sup>33</sup> the LORD will not leave him in the power of the wicked one or allow him to be condemned when he is judged. 
>
><sup>34</sup> Wait for the LORD and keep his way, and he will exalt you to inherit the land. You will watch when the wicked are destroyed. 
>
><sup>35</sup> I have seen a wicked, violent person well-rooted, like a flourishing native tree. 
>
><sup>36</sup> Then I passed by and noticed he was gone; I searched for him, but he could not be found. 
>
><sup>37</sup> Watch the blameless and observe the upright, for the person of peace will have a future. 
>
><sup>38</sup> But transgressors will all be eliminated; the future of the wicked will be destroyed. 
>
><sup>39</sup> The salvation of the righteous is from the LORD, their refuge in a time of distress. 
>
><sup>40</sup> The LORD helps and delivers them; he will deliver them from the wicked and will save them because they take refuge in him.
