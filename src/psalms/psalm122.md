# Praying Through: Psalm 122

## The Psalm

>Psalm 122 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A song of ascents. Of David. 
>
><sup>1</sup> I rejoiced with those who said to me, “Let’s go to the house of the LORD.” 
>
><sup>2</sup> Our feet were standing within your gates, Jerusalem— 
>
><sup>3</sup> Jerusalem, built as a city should be, solidly united, 
>
><sup>4</sup> where the tribes, the LORD’s tribes, go up to give thanks to the name of the LORD. (This is an ordinance for Israel.) 
>
><sup>5</sup> There, thrones for judgment are placed, thrones of the house of David. 
>
><sup>6</sup> Pray for the well-being of Jerusalem: “May those who love you be secure; 
>
><sup>7</sup> may there be peace within your walls, security within your fortresses.” 
>
><sup>8</sup> Because of my brothers and friends, I will say, “May peace be in you.” 
>
><sup>9</sup> Because of the house of the LORD our God, I will pursue your prosperity.

I love coming into your house

We rejoice
