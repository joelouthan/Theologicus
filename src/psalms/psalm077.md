# Praying Through: Psalm 77 Confidence

## The Psalm

>Psalm 77 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director: according to Jeduthun. Of Asaph. A psalm. 
>
><sup>1</sup> I cry aloud to God, aloud to God, and he will hear me. 
>
><sup>2</sup> I sought the Lord in my day of trouble. My hands were continually lifted up all night long; I refused to be comforted. 
>
><sup>3</sup> I think of God; I groan; I meditate; my spirit becomes weak. Selah 
>
><sup>4</sup> You have kept me from closing my eyes; I am troubled and cannot speak. 
>
><sup>5</sup> I consider days of old, years long past. 
>
><sup>6</sup> At night I remember my music; I meditate in my heart, and my spirit ponders. 
>
><sup>7</sup> “Will the Lord reject forever and never again show favor? 
>
><sup>8</sup> Has his faithful love ceased forever? Is his promise at an end for all generations? 
>
><sup>9</sup> Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he in anger withheld his compassion?” Selah 
>
><sup>10</sup> So I say, “I am grieved that the right hand of the Most High has changed.” 
>
><sup>11</sup> I will remember the LORD’s works; yes, I will remember your ancient wonders. 
>
><sup>12</sup> I will reflect on all you have done and meditate on your actions. 
>
><sup>13</sup> God, your way is holy. What god is great like God? 
>
><sup>14</sup> You are the God who works wonders; you revealed your strength among the peoples. 
>
><sup>15</sup> With power you redeemed your people, the descendants of Jacob and Joseph. Selah 
>
><sup>16</sup> The water saw you, God. The water saw you; it trembled. Even the depths shook. 
>
><sup>17</sup> The clouds poured down water. The storm clouds thundered; your arrows flashed back and forth. 
>
><sup>18</sup> The sound of your thunder was in the whirlwind; lightning lit up the world. The earth shook and quaked. 
>
><sup>19</sup> Your way went through the sea and your path through the vast water, but your footprints were unseen. 
>
><sup>20</sup> You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

Confidence

Your promises are sure.

You cannot reject me
* you cannot withhold your grace from me
* you cannot reject me
* nor forsake me
* you cannot stop loving me.

Because you have promised
* my acceptance
* your grace
* your calling
* your affections
* and your love.

How do I know?

Because I have your Son,
* Jesus Christ
* I always belong to my Beloved
* and He is mine forever.

Let me praise your holy name
* let me worship you with everything in me
* let me bless your wonderful name.

Amen.
