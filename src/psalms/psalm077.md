## The Prayer

Confidence
</div>


Your promises are sure.

You cannot reject me
  you cannot withhold your grace from me
  you cannot reject me
  nor forsake me
  you cannot stop loving me.

Because you have promised
  my acceptance
  your grace
  your calling
  your affections
  and your love.

How do I know?

Because I have your Son,
  Jesus Christ
  I always belong to my Beloved
  and He is mine forever.

Let me praise your holy name
  let me worship you with everything in me
  let me bless your wonderful name.

Amen.
