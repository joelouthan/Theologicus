# Praying Through: Psalm 30:11-12

<p style="clear:both;">

## The Psalm

>Psalm 30:11â€“12 (CSB)   You turned my lament into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness, so that I can sing to you and not be silent. LORD my God, I will praise you forever.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">Precious Redeemer</div>


I am going to worship you,
  all of my days
  for all of my life
  for all that I have.

I can declare this in boldness
  nothing of my own strength
  and I have no righteousness to speak of.

Because I have seen the fullness of your grace,
  and the ongoing gift of kindness
  the daily portion of mercies every morning
  and the steadfastness of your love.

I have failed
  but you are God.

Let my life and love and my words glorify you
  all of my days.
