## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

What you say
* I can take you at your word
* because you alone never lie
* and cannot lie
* and only speak truth
* and never in riddles
* and you are not waiting for me to figure it out
* you give me your law
* your word
* your gospel
* your prophecies
* and you did not leave me to my stupidity
* to my ignorance
* to figure on my own.

For you alone
* gave me your Son
* so that I would be born again
* gave your Spirit
* so my eyes would be opened
* so my ears would hear
* so my heart would understand
* so my mind could comprehend
* and you, my Father
* grant me maturity
* in your time
* for your glory
* and my good.

I love you so much.

Be glorified in me
* today.

Amen.
