# Praying Through: Psalm 74 Redeemer

## The Psalm

>Psalm 74 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A Maskil of Asaph. 
>
><sup>1</sup> Why have you rejected us forever, God? Why does your anger burn against the sheep of your pasture? 
>
><sup>2</sup> Remember your congregation, which you purchased long ago and redeemed as the tribe for your own possession. Remember Mount Zion where you dwell. 
>
><sup>3</sup> Make your way to the perpetual ruins, to all that the enemy has destroyed in the sanctuary. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Your adversaries roared in the meeting place where you met with us. They set up their emblems as signs. 
>
><sup>5</sup> It was like men in a thicket of trees, wielding axes, 
>
><sup>6</sup> then smashing all the carvings with hatchets and picks. 
>
><sup>7</sup> They set your sanctuary on fire; they utterly desecrated the dwelling place of your name. 
>
><sup>8</sup> They said in their hearts, “Let’s oppress them relentlessly.” They burned every place throughout the land where God met with us. 
>
><sup>9</sup> There are no signs for us to see. There is no longer a prophet. And none of us knows how long this will last. 
>
><sup>10</sup> God, how long will the enemy mock? Will the foe insult your name forever? 
>
><sup>11</sup> Why do you hold back your hand? Stretch out your right hand and destroy them! 
>
><sup>12</sup> God my King is from ancient times, performing saving acts on the earth. 
>
><sup>13</sup> You divided the sea with your strength; you smashed the heads of the sea monsters in the water; 
>
><sup>14</sup> you crushed the heads of Leviathan; you fed him to the creatures of the desert. 
>
><sup>15</sup> You opened up springs and streams; you dried up ever-flowing rivers. 
>
><sup>16</sup> The day is yours, also the night; you established the moon and the sun. 
>
><sup>17</sup> You set all the boundaries of the earth; you made summer and winter. 
>
><sup>18</sup> Remember this: the enemy has mocked the LORD, and a foolish people has insulted your name. 
>
><sup>19</sup> Do not give to beasts the life of your dove; do not forget the lives of your poor people forever. 
>
><sup>20</sup> Consider the covenant, for the dark places of the land are full of violence. 
>
><sup>21</sup> Do not let the oppressed turn away in shame; let the poor and needy praise your name. 
>
><sup>22</sup> Rise up, God, champion your cause! Remember the insults that fools bring against you all day long. 
>
><sup>23</sup> Do not forget the clamor of your adversaries, the tumult of your opponents that goes up constantly.

## The Prayer

My Redeemer
</div>

What terrible tragedies  
  have plagued my life  
  for all of my life?

Why must I take the brunt  
  of everyone's sins?
  They have tortured me  
  they have bruised me  
  they have wounded me  
  they have sought to kill me.

But, you, my God  
  have sustain my life thus far  
  I am now on the other side of tragic events  
  I am now on the other side of circumstances  
  I am now on the other side of pain  
  and I have seen clearly  
  where you have been with me  
  and where you are for me.

My God,
  It is that Satan and his demons  
  prisoners in their own sin and in the world  
  hell and death  
  sought my destruction  
  but I am not dead yet  
  because you have number my days  
  and my life is in your hands.

If I were to die here  
  I will forever live with you  
  and be with you.

All of my days  
  I will dwell in your house  
  forever.

It is there I will get to sing and worship and live and move  
  with you forever.

Do with me as you will  
  for you are my precious Lord and God  
  And I live to serve you alone.

Amen.
