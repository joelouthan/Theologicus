# Praying Through: Psalm 137

## The Psalm

>Psalm 137  
><sup>1</sup> By the rivers of Babylon— there we sat down and wept when we remembered Zion. 
>
><sup>2</sup> There we hung up our lyres on the poplar trees, 
>
><sup>3</sup> for our captors there asked us for songs, and our tormentors, for rejoicing: “Sing us one of the songs of Zion.” 
>
><sup>4</sup> How can we sing the LORD’s song on foreign soil? 
>
><sup>5</sup> If I forget you, Jerusalem, may my right hand forget its skill. 
>
><sup>6</sup> May my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I do not remember you, if I do not exalt Jerusalem as my greatest joy! 
>
><sup>7</sup> Remember, LORD, what the Edomites said that day at Jerusalem: “Destroy it! Destroy it down to its foundations!” 
>
><sup>8</sup> Daughter Babylon, doomed to destruction, happy is the one who pays you back what you have done to us. 
>
><sup>9</sup> Happy is he who takes your little ones and dashes them against the rocks.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Home
</div>

Lord, I know
* that we are strangers in this world,
* exiles
* aliens
* and immigrants
* we are not of this world
* but we live in this world.

We point all creatures
* to raise there eyes
* and see your Son
* Jesus Christ
* and believe
* and bring us all the way home.

We are here just for a little while.

You are our home, sustainer and portion.

Amen.
