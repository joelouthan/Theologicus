# Praying Through: Psalm 123

## The Psalm

>Psalm 123 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A song of ascents. 
>
><sup>1</sup> I lift my eyes to you, the one enthroned in heaven. 
>
><sup>2</sup> Like a servant’s eyes on his master’s hand, like a servant girl’s eyes on her mistress’s hand, so our eyes are on the LORD our God until he shows us favor. 
>
><sup>3</sup> Show us favor, LORD, show us favor, for we’ve had more than enough contempt. 
>
><sup>4</sup> We’ve had more than enough scorn from the arrogant and contempt from the proud.
