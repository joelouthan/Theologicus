# Praying Through: Psalm 132

## The Psalm

>Psalm 132 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A song of ascents. 
>
><sup>1</sup> LORD, remember David and all the hardships he endured, 
>
><sup>2</sup> and how he swore an oath to the LORD, making a vow to the Mighty One of Jacob: 
>
><sup>3</sup> “I will not enter my house or get into my bed, 
>
><sup>4</sup> I will not allow my eyes to sleep or my eyelids to slumber 
>
><sup>5</sup> until I find a place for the LORD, a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.” 
>
><sup>6</sup> We heard of the ark in Ephrathah; we found it in the fields of Jaar. 
>
><sup>7</sup> Let’s go to his dwelling place; let’s worship at his footstool. 
>
><sup>8</sup> Rise up, LORD, come to your resting place, you and your powerful ark. 
>
><sup>9</sup> May your priests be clothed with righteousness, and may your faithful people shout for joy. 
>
><sup>10</sup> For the sake of your servant David, do not reject your anointed one. 
>
><sup>11</sup> The LORD swore an oath to David, a promise he will not abandon: “I will set one of your offspring on your throne. 
>
><sup>12</sup> If your sons keep my covenant and my decrees that I will teach them, their sons will also sit on your throne forever.” 
>
><sup>13</sup> For the LORD has chosen Zion; he has desired it for his home: 
>
><sup>14</sup> “This is my resting place forever; I will make my home here because I have desired it. 
>
><sup>15</sup> I will abundantly bless its food; I will satisfy its needy with bread. 
>
><sup>16</sup> I will clothe its priests with salvation, and its faithful people will shout for joy. 
>
><sup>17</sup> There I will make a horn grow for David; I have prepared a lamp for my anointed one. 
>
><sup>18</sup> I will clothe his enemies with shame, but the crown he wears will be glorious.”
