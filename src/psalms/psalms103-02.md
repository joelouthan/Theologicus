## The Psalm

>Psalm 103:2 (CSB)   My soul, bless the LORD, and do not forget all his benefits. 

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Lord
</div>


I cannot believe that you would be so mindful of me.

You have seen me in the fallen state
  and you took pity on me.

You know that I could not save myself 
  and I was good as dead.

I was once foolish and led astray
  enslaved by my sin and my desires.

But you sent your Son
  to come rescue me
  to save me from death
  to capture me
  and make me yours.

You are the lover of my soul
  and the king of my heart.

You are my portion and my rock
  forever.

I make no claim to myself
  I am yours.

Be glorified today.

Amen.
