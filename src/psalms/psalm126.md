# Praying Through: Psalm 126

## The Psalm

>Psalm 126 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A song of ascents. 
>
><sup>1</sup> When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like those who dream. 
>
><sup>2</sup> Our mouths were filled with laughter then, and our tongues with shouts of joy. Then they said among the nations, “The LORD has done great things for them.” 
>
><sup>3</sup> The LORD had done great things for us; we were joyful. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Restore our fortunes, LORD, like watercourses in the Negev. 
>
><sup>5</sup> Those who sow in tears will reap with shouts of joy. 
>
><sup>6</sup> Though one goes along weeping, carrying the bag of seed, he will surely come back with shouts of joy, carrying his sheaves.
