## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Worthy is Your Grace
</div>

I will never stop
* writing words
* sing songs
* mulling thoughts
* sleeping in my dreams
* reading books
* dwelling in your word
* filled with your Spirit
* to try do my best
* to express the grace
* that you have drowned me in
* lavished upon my life
* that is more than all the riches in the world
* more than the deepest minds
* the greatest wisdom
* all the love
* all of everything.

Your grace
* is more than my pain
* my despair
* my deceit
* my hurts
* my wounds
* my brokenness
* my trauma
* the sin committed against me
* the sin I have committed against others
* all the evil in this world.

Your grace
* was fulfilled
* perfect
* complete
* totality
* definite
* found in your Son
* Jesus Christ.

Now I am saved

Now I am yours

Now you are mine

Your presence is forever with me
* and I am forever in your grasp
* No one can ever remove me
* nothing can ever separate us
* nothing can come between us.

Your grace
* is worth more
* than anything I ever had in this world
* and the best of anything I have ever lost.

You found me
* and now I have everything
* because I have you
* You are my heart and my love and joy forever.

Amen.
