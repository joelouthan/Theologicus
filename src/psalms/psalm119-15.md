# Praying Through: Psalm 119:15

## The Psalm

>Psalms 119:15 (CSB) I will meditate on your precepts and think about your ways.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

I do not have the intelligence
* nor the drive
* nor the will
* nor the discipline
* nor the effort
* nor the where-with-all
* nor the desire
* nor the wisdom
* to pursue your word
* to read your word
* to understand your word
* to comprehend your word
* to meditate on your word.

I don't got it in me.

Because if I did
* I would have read your word
* understand it
* and do what you say
* perfectly
* to the letter.

But I see mere parts of your word
* and in my finite comprehension
* fail to do every part.

If I understood
* I would have done
* but I do not understand
* and I sin against you.

Nonetheless
* I have your Word
* and he dwells in me
* and your Spirit
* makes me alive
* my heart to love
* comes from you.

I am weak and feeble
* ignorant and foolish
* but you have saved me
* from my own sins and depravity
* once and for all
* forever.

I love you.

Amen.
