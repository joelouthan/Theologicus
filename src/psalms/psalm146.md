# Praying Through: Psalm 146

## The Psalm

>Psalm 146 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> Hallelujah! My soul, praise the LORD. 
>
><sup>2</sup> I will praise the LORD all my life; I will sing to my God as long as I live. 
>
><sup>3</sup> Do not trust in nobles, in a son of man, who cannot save. 
>
><sup>4</sup> When his breath leaves him, he returns to the ground; on that day his plans die. 
>
><sup>5</sup> Happy is the one whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the LORD his God, 
>
><sup>6</sup> the Maker of heaven and earth, the sea and everything in them. He remains faithful forever, 
>
><sup>7</sup> executing justice for the exploited and giving food to the hungry. The LORD frees prisoners. 
>
><sup>8</sup> The LORD opens the eyes of the blind. The LORD raises up those who are oppressed. The LORD loves the righteous. 
>
><sup>9</sup> The LORD protects resident aliens and helps the fatherless and the widow, but he frustrates the ways of the wicked. 
>
><sup>10</sup> The LORD reigns forever; Zion, your God reigns for all generations. Hallelujah!
