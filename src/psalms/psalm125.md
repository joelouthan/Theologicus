# Praying Through: Psalm 125

## The Psalm

>>Psalm 125 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A song of ascents. 
>
><sup>1</sup> Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion. It cannot be shaken; it remains forever. 
>
><sup>2</sup> The mountains surround Jerusalem and the LORD surrounds his people, both now and forever. 
>
><sup>3</sup> The scepter of the wicked will not remain over the land allotted to the righteous, so that the righteous will not apply their hands to injustice. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Do what is good, LORD, to the good, to those whose hearts are upright. 
>
><sup>5</sup> But as for those who turn aside to crooked ways, the LORD will banish them with the evildoers. Peace be with Israel.

## The Prayer

The love you give
* is steadfast
* never ceases.

The mercies you've shown
* never come to an end.

The grace you have for me
* is layered
* like an ocean
* on a ocean.

The faith you have gifted me
* is the unbreakable chain
* that connects to your Almight.

THe Spirit that dwells in me
* gives me trueness 
* and fullness of life.

The Son that I have
* is mine
* and I am his
* forever.
