## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

You have given me life when I was dead.

I keep trying to go back to my sins
* but you have granted me your almighty strength
* to turn back to you
* granted me your grace upon grace
* to bath in your compassion
* granted tenderest mercies
* to look upon your blessed face
* your everlasting love
* to bring me all the way home.

This is your word
* and I will praise you till I die
* and forevermore.

Amen.
