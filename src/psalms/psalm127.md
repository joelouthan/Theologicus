# Praying Through: Psalm 127

## The Psalm

>Psalm 127 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A song of ascents. Of Solomon. 
>
><sup>1</sup> Unless the LORD builds a house, its builders labor over it in vain; unless the LORD watches over a city, the watchman stays alert in vain. 
>
><sup>2</sup> In vain you get up early and stay up late, working hard to have enough food— yes, he gives sleep to the one he loves. 
>
><sup>3</sup> Sons are indeed a heritage from the LORD, offspring, a reward. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Like arrows in the hand of a warrior are the sons born in one’s youth. 
>
><sup>5</sup> Happy is the man who has filled his quiver with them. They will never be put to shame when they speak with their enemies at the city gate.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Provision and Sustainer
</div>

I dare not think
* if I did not have you
* where would I be?

Surely, I would perish
* I would not be fit for this earth
* because I would be no good for this earth
* my life would be expired.

But since you are my Lord and my God
* you sought fit
* to redeem me
* to save me
* to raise me from death in my sin
* to give me life
* to worship you
* all of my days.

So with all that is in me
* and all of my days
* I will bless your holy name
* forever.

Amen.
