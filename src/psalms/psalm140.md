# Praying Through: Psalm 140

## The Psalm

>Psalm 140  
><sup></sup> For the choir director. A psalm of David. 
>
><sup>1</sup> Rescue me, LORD, from evil men. Keep me safe from violent men 
>
><sup>2</sup> who plan evil in their hearts. They stir up wars all day long. 
>
><sup>3</sup> They make their tongues as sharp as a snake’s bite; viper’s venom is under their lips. Selah 
>
><sup>4</sup> Protect me, LORD, from the power of the wicked. Keep me safe from violent men who plan to make me stumble. 
>
><sup>5</sup> The proud hide a trap with ropes for me; they spread a net along the path and set snares for me. Selah 
>
><sup>6</sup> I say to the LORD, “You are my God.” Listen, LORD, to my cry for help. 
>
><sup>7</sup> LORD, my Lord, my strong Savior, you shield my head on the day of battle. 
>
><sup>8</sup> LORD, do not grant the desires of the wicked; do not let them achieve their goals. Otherwise, they will become proud. Selah 
>
><sup>9</sup> When those who surround me rise up, may the trouble their lips cause overwhelm them. 
>
><sup>10</sup> Let hot coals fall on them. Let them be thrown into the fire, into the abyss, never again to rise. 
>
><sup>11</sup> Do not let a slanderer stay in the land. Let evil relentlessly hunt down a violent man. 
>
><sup>12</sup> I know that the LORD upholds the just cause of the poor, justice for the needy. 
>
><sup>13</sup> Surely the righteous will praise your name; the upright will live in your presence.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
O Lord
</div>

Whatever my fell me
* save me from my sins
* keep me from perishing
* protect me from Satan and his demons
* pull me from hell.

You have been my only Savior
* in you alone do I trust.

I will bless your name
* for all of my days.

Amen.
