# Praying Through: Psalm 141

## The Psalm

>Psalm 141 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A psalm of David. 
>
><sup>1</sup> LORD, I call on you; hurry to help me. Listen to my voice when I call on you. 
>
><sup>2</sup> May my prayer be set before you as incense, the raising of my hands as the evening offering. 
>
><sup>3</sup> LORD, set up a guard for my mouth; keep watch at the door of my lips. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Do not let my heart turn to any evil thing or perform wicked acts with evildoers. Do not let me feast on their delicacies. 
>
><sup>5</sup> Let the righteous one strike me— it is an act of faithful love; let him rebuke me— it is oil for my head; let me not refuse it. Even now my prayer is against the evil acts of the wicked. 
>
><sup>6</sup> When their rulers will be thrown off the sides of a cliff, the people will listen to my words, for they are pleasing. 
>
><sup>7</sup> As when one plows and breaks up the soil, turning up rocks, so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol. 
>
><sup>8</sup> But my eyes look to you, LORD, my Lord. I seek refuge in you; do not let me die. 
>
><sup>9</sup> Protect me from the trap they have set for me, and from the snares of evildoers. 
>
><sup>10</sup> Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by safely.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Only Help and Hope
</div>

When I have called
* you have always answered
* you have rescued me 
* more than times than I count.

You are my only hope and stay.

And I love you, Lord
* and with all that is in me
* I will forever
* bless your holy name.

Amen.
