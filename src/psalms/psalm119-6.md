# Praying Through: Psalm 119:6

## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:6 (CSB) Then I would not be ashamed when I think about all your commands.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

My entire life
* is filled with shame
* and guild
* and regret
* and my sin
* is my own undoing
* I have been crushed
* I cannot handle
* the sheer amount of shame
* that has tortured my soul.

But your holy Son
* bore my grief
* bear my shame
* took on my guilt
* and received my only gift I could give to you
* my wickedness
* my depravity
* my sin.

Now I live unto you
* you are my holy God
* and my Lord
* forevermore.

And I love you.

Amen.
