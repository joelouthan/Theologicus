# Praying Through: Psalm 120

## The Psalm

>Psalm 120 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A song of ascents. 
>
><sup>1</sup> In my distress I called to the LORD, and he answered me. 
>
><sup>2</sup> “LORD, rescue me from lying lips and a deceitful tongue.” 
>
><sup>3</sup> What will he give you, and what will he do to you, you deceitful tongue? 
>
><sup>4</sup> A warrior’s sharp arrows with burning charcoal! 
>
><sup>5</sup> What misery that I have stayed in Meshech, that I have lived among the tents of Kedar! 
>
><sup>6</sup> I have dwelt too long with those who hate peace. 
>
><sup>7</sup> I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Truth
</div>

Shall I worry about those
* who would do me harm?

If I did
* then I would worry all of my life.

But what my lying lips
* and deceitful tongue
* I sin with them constantly
* and it seems I cannot stop.

But I call to you, LORD
* and you answer me
* because your Son and Spirit
* dwell in me
* and you answer me
* swiftly and quickly.

You have cleansed me
* from all unrighteousness
* even with my lying lips
* which are incapable of speaking the truth
* and with my deceitful tongue
* which it is impossible
* to give you the perfect repentance 
* that you have commanded me to give.

But you knew that
* you knew I was a sinner
* ultra weak in the flesh
* you saved me
* but I am being put to death
* all the day long.

I will not worry about
* any one who does me harm
* cleansed my lips
* and my tongue
* and my throat
* and my heart
* and my mind

May the words of my mouth
* and the meditations of my heart
* be acceptable in your sight--
* and I know they are
* because I have your only begotten Son
* my only, only
* Lord Jesus Christ.

Amen.
