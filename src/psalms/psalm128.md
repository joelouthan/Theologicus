# Praying Through: Psalm 128

## The Psalm

><sup></sup> A song of ascents. 
>
><sup>1</sup> How happy is everyone who fears the LORD, who walks in his ways! 
>
><sup>2</sup> You will surely eat what your hands have worked for. You will be happy, and it will go well for you. 
>
><sup>3</sup> Your wife will be like a fruitful vine within your house, your children, like young olive trees around your table. 
>
><sup>4</sup> In this very way the man who fears the LORD will be blessed.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Blessing & Keeping
</div>

You are my great God
* who sought in your good pleasure
* to create me
* to be on this earth
* but more so
* before the mountains were formed
* you saw the depths of my heart
* you knew my wickedness
* and you cared enough
* to save me
* to keep me
* to bless me.

I am so immensely blessed
* from your own hand
* and I have everything
* because I have your only begotten Son
* my only, only Lord Jesus Christ.

I love you
* and all that is in me
* I will bless your holy name
* forevermore.

Amen.
