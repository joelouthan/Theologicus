# Praying Through: Psalm 109 Merciful

## The Psalm

>Psalm 109 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director. A psalm of David. 
>
><sup>1</sup> God of my praise, do not be silent. 
>
><sup>2</sup> For wicked and deceitful mouths open against me; they speak against me with lying tongues. 
>
><sup>3</sup> They surround me with hateful words and attack me without cause. 
>
><sup>4</sup> In return for my love they accuse me, but I continue to pray. 
>
><sup>5</sup> They repay me evil for good, and hatred for my love. 
>
><sup>6</sup> Set a wicked person over him; let an accuser stand at his right hand. 
>
><sup>7</sup> When he is judged, let him be found guilty, and let his prayer be counted as sin. 
>
><sup>8</sup> Let his days be few; let another take over his position. 
>
><sup>9</sup> Let his children be fatherless and his wife a widow. 
>
><sup>10</sup> Let his children wander as beggars, searching for food far from their demolished homes. 
>
><sup>11</sup> Let a creditor seize all he has; let strangers plunder what he has worked for. 
>
><sup>12</sup> Let no one show him kindness, and let no one be gracious to his fatherless children. 
>
><sup>13</sup> Let the line of his descendants be cut off; let their name be blotted out in the next generation. 
>
><sup>14</sup> Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the LORD, and do not let his mother’s sin be blotted out. 
>
><sup>15</sup> Let their sins always remain before the LORD, and let him remove all memory of them from the earth. 
>
><sup>16</sup> For he did not think to show kindness, but pursued the suffering, needy, and brokenhearted in order to put them to death. 
>
><sup>17</sup> He loved cursing—let it fall on him; he took no delight in blessing—let it be far from him. 
>
><sup>18</sup> He wore cursing like his coat— let it enter his body like water and go into his bones like oil. 
>
><sup>19</sup> Let it be like a robe he wraps around himself, like a belt he always wears. 
>
><sup>20</sup> Let this be the LORD’s payment to my accusers, to those who speak evil against me. 
>
><sup>21</sup> But you, LORD, my Lord, deal kindly with me for your name’s sake; because your faithful love is good, rescue me. 
>
><sup>22</sup> For I am suffering and needy; my heart is wounded within me. 
>
><sup>23</sup> I fade away like a lengthening shadow; I am shaken off like a locust. 
>
><sup>24</sup> My knees are weak from fasting, and my body is emaciated. 
>
><sup>25</sup> I have become an object of ridicule to my accusers; when they see me, they shake their heads in scorn. 
>
><sup>26</sup> Help me, LORD my God; save me according to your faithful love 
>
><sup>27</sup> so they may know that this is your hand and that you, LORD, have done it. 
>
><sup>28</sup> Though they curse, you will bless. When they rise up, they will be put to shame, but your servant will rejoice. 
>
><sup>29</sup> My accusers will be clothed with disgrace; they will wear their shame like a cloak. 
>
><sup>30</sup> I will fervently thank the LORD with my mouth; I will praise him in the presence of many. 
>
><sup>31</sup> For he stands at the right hand of the needy to save him from those who would condemn him.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Lord
</div>

I am not the one  
  who is upright  
  and blameless  

I am the one  
  who is wicked  
  full of malice  
  and anger  
  and unholiness  
  and unrighteousness  
  blameful  
  in all of my ways.  

I am the sinful one  
  who wars against you  
  who battles against your holy name  
  who trespasses with every beat of my heart  
  I am the one who is guilty  
  and deserving of your great wrath.  

Nonetheless  
  you saw me in my sin  
  and you loved me  
  you saw me as your enemy  
  and set out  
  not to destroy me  
  but to save me  
  not just spared from your wrath  
  but to be your child  
  forever and ever.  

I know this  
  because you have sent  
  your only begotten Son  
  to live and die for me  
  so I can die and live with you  
  forever and ever.

And I know this  
  because your Holy Spirit  
  dwells in me  
  never to leave me  
  but to bear witness with my Spirit  
  that I belong to you  
  and you belong to me  
  forever and ever.

I will always fail  
  but you are the strength of my heart  
  and my portion forever.  

Save me, Lord  
  I am in need of saving.  

Amen.
