# Praying Through: Psalm 119:5

## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:5 (CSB) If only my ways were committed to keeping your statutes!

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

If I could  
* even for a moment  
* to perfect obey you  
* I would  
* exchange for everything I got  
* to do so.

But all of what I have  
* could not buy a ounce of righteousness.

So instead  
* you gave everything  
* that heaven and earth could hold  
* your precious Son  
* to be my Savior  
* forever.

I will praise your holy name forever.

Amen.
