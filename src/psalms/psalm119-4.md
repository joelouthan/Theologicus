# Praying Through: Psalm 119:4

## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:4 (CSB) You have commanded that your precepts be diligently kept.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

I have failed you  
* time and time again  
* I am so far from keeping your precepts  
* I have broken all of your laws  
* I live in this body death  
* where can I go  
* only to Sheol  
* to sit under your deserving wrath.

But that not what you have determined  
* you will not let me rot in hell  
* you have not given me over to my own wickedness and worthlessness  
* you have promptly and completely removed my sin  
* and you placed upon your loving Son.

Your wrath  
* placed on him  
* he descended into hell  
* for me  
* but since he is the spotless Lamb who was slain  
* not one stitch of infection of Satan and demons could grab onto.

Christ descended into hell--righteous, holy, and blameless  
* he ascended from hell--holy, righteous, and blameless.

That death was mine  
* now his life is mine.

I will praise your name forever.

Amen
