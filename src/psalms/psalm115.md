# Praying Through: Psalm 115 Trustworthy

## The Psalm

>Psalm 115 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> Not to us, LORD, not to us, but to your name give glory because of your faithful love, because of your truth. 
>
><sup>2</sup> Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?” 
>
><sup>3</sup> Our God is in heaven and does whatever he pleases. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Their idols are silver and gold, made by human hands. 
>
><sup>5</sup> They have mouths but cannot speak, eyes, but cannot see. 
>
><sup>6</sup> They have ears but cannot hear, noses, but cannot smell. 
>
><sup>7</sup> They have hands but cannot feel, feet, but cannot walk. They cannot make a sound with their throats. 
>
><sup>8</sup> Those who make them are just like them, as are all who trust in them. 
>
><sup>9</sup> Israel, trust in the LORD! He is their help and shield. 
>
><sup>10</sup> House of Aaron, trust in the LORD! He is their help and shield. 
>
><sup>11</sup> You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD! He is their help and shield. 
>
><sup>12</sup> The LORD remembers us and will bless us. He will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron; 
>
><sup>13</sup> he will bless those who fear the LORD— small and great alike. 
>
><sup>14</sup> May the LORD add to your numbers, both yours and your children’s. 
>
><sup>15</sup> May you be blessed by the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth. 
>
><sup>16</sup> The heavens are the LORD’s, but the earth he has given to the human race. 
>
><sup>17</sup> It is not the dead who praise the LORD, nor any of those descending into the silence of death. 
>
><sup>18</sup> But we will bless the LORD, both now and forever. Hallelujah!

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Lord
</div>

I have cling mightily  
* to my worthless idols  
* to my wicked deeds  
* to my selfish desires  
* to my own righteousness

And you  
* you alone  
* have rescued me  
* from the pit I have dug  
* from the sin I have committed  
* from the death I have earned  
* from the hell I have deserved

In my little life  
* be glorified  
* I have nowhere else to turn  
* you alone  
* have the words  
* to eternal life

Amen.
