>
><sup>5</sup> I called to the LORD in distress; the LORD answered me and put me in a spacious place. 
>
><sup>6</sup> The LORD is for me; I will not be afraid. What can a mere mortal do to me?

><sup>7</sup> The LORD is my helper; therefore, I will look in triumph on those who hate me. 
>
><sup>8</sup> It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in humanity. 
>
><sup>9</sup> It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in nobles.

><sup>10</sup> All the nations surrounded me; in the name of the LORD I destroyed them. 
>
><sup>11</sup> They surrounded me, yes, they surrounded me; in the name of the LORD I destroyed them. 
>
><sup>12</sup> They surrounded me like bees; they were extinguished like a fire among thorns; in the name of the LORD I destroyed them. 
>
><sup>13</sup> They pushed me hard to make me fall, but the LORD helped me. 
>
><sup>14</sup> The LORD is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation. 
>
><sup>15</sup> There are shouts of joy and victory in the tents of the righteous: “The LORD’s right hand performs valiantly! 
>
><sup>16</sup> The LORD’s right hand is raised. The LORD’s right hand performs valiantly!” 
>
><sup>17</sup> I will not die, but I will live and proclaim what the LORD has done. 
>
><sup>18</sup> The LORD disciplined me severely but did not give me over to death. 
>
><sup>19</sup> Open the gates of righteousness for me; I will enter through them and give thanks to the LORD. 
>
><sup>20</sup> This is the LORD’s gate; the righteous will enter through it. 
>
><sup>21</sup> I will give thanks to you because you have answered me and have become my salvation. 
>
><sup>22</sup> The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. 
>
><sup>23</sup> This came from the LORD; it is wondrous in our sight. 
>
><sup>24</sup> This is the day the LORD has made; let’s rejoice and be glad in it. 
>
><sup>25</sup> LORD, save us! LORD, please grant us success! 
>
><sup>26</sup> He who comes in the name of the LORD is blessed. From the house of the LORD we bless you. 
>
><sup>27</sup> The LORD is God and has given us light. Bind the festival sacrifice with cords to the horns of the altar. 
>
><sup>28</sup> You are my God, and I will give you thanks. You are my God; I will exalt you. 
>
><sup>29</sup> Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his faithful love endures forever.
