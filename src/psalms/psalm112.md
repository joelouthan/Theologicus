# Praying Through: Psalm 112 Light

## The Psalm

>Psalm 112 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> Hallelujah! Happy is the person who fears the LORD, taking great delight in his commands. 
>
><sup>2</sup> His descendants will be powerful in the land; the generation of the upright will be blessed. 
>
><sup>3</sup> Wealth and riches are in his house, and his righteousness endures forever. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Light shines in the darkness for the upright. He is gracious, compassionate, and righteous. 
>
><sup>5</sup> Good will come to the one who lends generously and conducts his business fairly. 
>
><sup>6</sup> He will never be shaken. The righteous one will be remembered forever. 
>
><sup>7</sup> He will not fear bad news; his heart is confident, trusting in the LORD. 
>
><sup>8</sup> His heart is assured; he will not fear. In the end he will look in triumph on his foes. 
>
><sup>9</sup> He distributes freely to the poor; his righteousness endures forever. His horn will be exalted in honor. 
>
><sup>10</sup> The wicked one will see it and be angry; he will gnash his teeth in despair. The desire of the wicked leads to ruin.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Lord
</div>

When you sent your Son
* to open my eyes
* to open my ears
* to unmute my tongue
* to open my mind
* to make his home in my heart.

I see the light of the world
* and I no longer love the darkness.

I am your child forever.

Amen.
