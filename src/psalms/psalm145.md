## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Only Blessing
</div>

If I had every single word
* in every language
* and I created
* all other languages
* that ever were
* or ever will be
* and I could speak them all
* I still would fall infinitely short
* of descibing your loveliness.

You are my heart and love.

You are my King Jesus.

Amen.
