# Praying Through: Psalm 119:11

## The Psalm

## The Prayer

>Psalm 119:11 (CSB) I have treasured your word in my heart so that I may not sin against you.

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

This is where I need the most help
* you have given me a supernatural grace
* and a renewed mind
* and your heart
* and Spirit
* to understand
* what you have give me
* your blessed word.

I remember my darkest times
* and terrible chaos
* when I was at my weakest
* I still remember
* that I was your son
* and you have not abandoned me

If I do lose my mind
* I will never lose you
* keep me from sinning against you
* because it tears me away from you.

Come rescue me
* every time
* because you have always rescued me

Come Lord Jesus.

Amen.
