# Psalm 35

>Of David. 
>
><sup>1</sup> Oppose my opponents, LORD; fight those who fight me. 
>
><sup>2</sup> Take your shields—large and small— and come to my aid. 
>
><sup>3</sup> Draw the spear and javelin against my pursuers, and assure me, “I am your deliverance.” 
>
><sup>4</sup> Let those who intend to take my life be disgraced and humiliated; let those who plan to harm me be turned back and ashamed. 
>
><sup>5</sup> Let them be like chaff in the wind, with the angel of the LORD driving them away. 
>
><sup>6</sup> Let their way be dark and slippery, with the angel of the LORD pursuing them. 
>
><sup>7</sup> They hid their net for me without cause; they dug a pit for me without cause. 
>
><sup>8</sup> Let ruin come on him unexpectedly, and let the net that he hid ensnare him; let him fall into it—to his ruin. 
>
><sup>9</sup> Then I will rejoice in the LORD; I will delight in his deliverance. 
>
><sup>10</sup> All my bones will say, “LORD, who is like you, rescuing the poor from one too strong for him, the poor or the needy from one who robs him?” 
>
><sup>11</sup> Malicious witnesses come forward; they question me about things I do not know. 
>
><sup>12</sup> They repay me evil for good, making me desolate. 
>
><sup>13</sup> Yet when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth; I humbled myself with fasting, and my prayer was genuine. 
>
><sup>14</sup> I went about mourning as if for my friend or brother; I was bowed down with grief, like one mourning for a mother. 
>
><sup>15</sup> But when I stumbled, they gathered in glee; they gathered against me. Assailants I did not know tore at me and did not stop. 
>
><sup>16</sup> With godless mockery they gnashed their teeth at me. 
>
><sup>17</sup> Lord, how long will you look on? Rescue me from their ravages; rescue my precious life from the young lions. 
>
><sup>18</sup> I will praise you in the great assembly; I will exalt you among many people. 
>
><sup>19</sup> Do not let my deceitful enemies rejoice over me; do not let those who hate me without cause wink at me maliciously. 
>
><sup>20</sup> For they do not speak in friendly ways, but contrive fraudulent schemes against those who live peacefully in the land. 
>
><sup>21</sup> They open their mouths wide against me and say, “Aha, aha! We saw it!” 
>
><sup>22</sup> You saw it, LORD; do not be silent. Lord, do not be far from me. 
>
><sup>23</sup> Wake up and rise to my defense, to my cause, my God and my Lord! 
>
><sup>24</sup> Vindicate me, LORD my God, in keeping with your righteousness, and do not let them rejoice over me. 
>
><sup>25</sup> Do not let them say in their hearts, “Aha! Just what we wanted.” Do not let them say, “We have swallowed him up!” 
>
><sup>26</sup> Let those who rejoice at my misfortune be disgraced and humiliated; let those who exalt themselves over me be clothed with shame and reproach. 
>
><sup>27</sup> Let those who want my vindication shout for joy and be glad; let them continually say, “The LORD be exalted. He takes pleasure in his servant’s well-being.” 
>
><sup>28</sup> And my tongue will proclaim your righteousness, your praise all day long.
