## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>
I know your word
  and since I know it
  I cannot unknow it
  I am not ignorant of it
  I must abide in it

But the more I know of your law
  the more I know I do not keep it
  I fall infinitely short of your glory
  I am not perfect
  please show me mercy
  send your Christ
  once and for all
  to obey your law for me
  so I can be free
  to obey you
  with the power of your Spirit
  that dwells in me.

Be exalted, O God.

Amen.
