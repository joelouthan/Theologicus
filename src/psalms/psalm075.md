# Praying Through: Psalm 75 Judge

## The Psalm

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Judge
</div>


I lived my life
  as the absolute chief of sinners
  fulfilling my heart's desires
  for all the lustful and rage-filled wickedness
  blaspheming your holy name
  attempting to weaken and mock those who worship you
  and violently opposing your holy name.

But you, my Christ,
  rule and reign
  as the absolute chief of grace
  and gives the most mercy
  in your steadfast kindness
  to sinners just like me.

Keep me in your love
  and keep my heart towards you
  you are my King Jesus
  and you are the judge and keeper of my life.

Amen.
