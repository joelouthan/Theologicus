# Praying Through: Psalm 75 Judge

## The Psalm

>Psalm 75 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director: “Do Not Destroy.” A psalm of Asaph. A song. 
>
><sup>1</sup> We give thanks to you, God; we give thanks to you, for your name is near. People tell about your wondrous works. 
>
><sup>2</sup> “When I choose a time, I will judge fairly. 
>
><sup>3</sup> When the earth and all its inhabitants shake, I am the one who steadies its pillars. Selah 
>
><sup>4</sup> I say to the boastful, ‘Do not boast,’ and to the wicked, ‘Do not lift up your horn. 
>
><sup>5</sup> Do not lift up your horn against heaven or speak arrogantly.’ ” 
>
><sup>6</sup> Exaltation does not come from the east, the west, or the desert, 
>
><sup>7</sup> for God is the Judge: He brings down one and exalts another. 
>
><sup>8</sup> For there is a cup in the LORD’s hand, full of wine blended with spices, and he pours from it. All the wicked of the earth will drink, draining it to the dregs. 
>
><sup>9</sup> As for me, I will tell about him forever; I will sing praise to the God of Jacob. 
>
><sup>10</sup> “I will cut off all the horns of the wicked, but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.”

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Judge
</div>

I lived my life  
* as the absolute chief of sinners  
* fulfilling my heart's desires  
* for all the lustful and rage-filled wickedness  
* blaspheming your holy name  
* attempting to weaken and mock those who worship you  
* and violently opposing your holy name.

But you, my Christ,
* rule and reign  
* as the absolute chief of grace  
* and gives the most mercy  
* in your steadfast kindness  
* to sinners just like me.

Keep me in your love  
* and keep my heart towards you  
* you are my King Jesus  
* and you are the judge and keeper of my life.

Amen.
