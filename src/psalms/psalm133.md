# Praying Through: Psalm 133

## The Psalm

>Psalm 133 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A song of ascents. Of David. 
>
><sup>1</sup> How delightfully good when brothers live together in harmony! 
>
><sup>2</sup> It is like fine oil on the head, running down on the beard, running down Aaron’s beard onto his robes. 
>
><sup>3</sup> It is like the dew of Hermon falling on the mountains of Zion. For there the LORD has appointed the blessing— life forevermore.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Eldest Brother
</div>

Thank you for gathering us
* into your family
* into your church
* so that we can live together
* and know one another
* and love one another.

I remember moving to a foreign land
* knowing no one
* and being all alone
* my prayers ahead of time
* above all things
* give me a church, O Lord
* and look
* you have provided
* within a month of arriving
* you provided a church
* for me and my family.

You were so quick to answer
* and respond and provide
* I love you with all of my heart
* and I am so grateful
* and I will bless your holy name
* my King Jesus.

Amen.
