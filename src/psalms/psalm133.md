# Praying Through: Psalm 133

## The Psalm

>Psalm 133 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A song of ascents. Of David. 
>
><sup>1</sup> How delightfully good when brothers live together in harmony! 
>
><sup>2</sup> It is like fine oil on the head, running down on the beard, running down Aaron’s beard onto his robes. 
>
><sup>3</sup> It is like the dew of Hermon falling on the mountains of Zion. For there the LORD has appointed the blessing— life forevermore.
