# Praying Through: Psalm 139

## The Psalm

>Psalm 139 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director. A psalm of David. 
>
><sup>1</sup> LORD, you have searched me and known me. 
>
><sup>2</sup> You know when I sit down and when I stand up; you understand my thoughts from far away. 
>
><sup>3</sup> You observe my travels and my rest; you are aware of all my ways. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Before a word is on my tongue, you know all about it, LORD. 
>
><sup>5</sup> You have encircled me; you have placed your hand on me. 
>
><sup>6</sup> This wondrous knowledge is beyond me. It is lofty; I am unable to reach it. 
>
><sup>7</sup> Where can I go to escape your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence? 
>
><sup>8</sup> If I go up to heaven, you are there; if I make my bed in Sheol, you are there. 
>
><sup>9</sup> If I live at the eastern horizon or settle at the western limits, 
>
><sup>10</sup> even there your hand will lead me; your right hand will hold on to me. 
>
><sup>11</sup> If I say, “Surely the darkness will hide me, and the light around me will be night”— 
>
><sup>12</sup> even the darkness is not dark to you. The night shines like the day; darkness and light are alike to you. 
>
><sup>13</sup> For it was you who created my inward parts; you knit me together in my mother’s womb. 
>
><sup>14</sup> I will praise you because I have been remarkably and wondrously made. Your works are wondrous, and I know this very well. 
>
><sup>15</sup> My bones were not hidden from you when I was made in secret, when I was formed in the depths of the earth. 
>
><sup>16</sup> Your eyes saw me when I was formless; all my days were written in your book and planned before a single one of them began. 
>
><sup>17</sup> God, how precious your thoughts are to me; how vast their sum is! 
>
><sup>18</sup> If I counted them, they would outnumber the grains of sand; when I wake up, I am still with you. 
>
><sup>19</sup> God, if only you would kill the wicked— you bloodthirsty men, stay away from me— 
>
><sup>20</sup> who invoke you deceitfully. Your enemies swear by you falsely. 
>
><sup>21</sup> LORD, don’t I hate those who hate you, and detest those who rebel against you? 
>
><sup>22</sup> I hate them with extreme hatred; I consider them my enemies. 
>
><sup>23</sup> Search me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my concerns. 
>
><sup>24</sup> See if there is any offensive way in me; lead me in the everlasting way.

O Lord

Thank you for loving me and giving me all of your affections.

And I know I have your love because I have your only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, my only Savior and Lord.

Amen.
