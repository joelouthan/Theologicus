## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

All of your commands
* your decrees
* your statutes
* your precepts
* your laws

You have given me the power
* to obey them
* to fulfill them
* to walk in them
* and to enjoy them.

What is this power?
* None other than my King Jesus
* whom you have given to me
* with the same power by the Spirit
* that raised up your Son from death

Now I have true life
* in my mortal body
* all because of what your Son has done.

I thank you
* for giving me your
* precious and perfect
* law obeyer.

Make me look like Jesus.

Amen.
