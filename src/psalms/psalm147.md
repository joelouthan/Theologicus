# Praying Through: Psalm 147

## The Psalm

>Psalm 147 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> Hallelujah! How good it is to sing to our God, for praise is pleasant and lovely. 
>
><sup>2</sup> The LORD rebuilds Jerusalem; he gathers Israelâ€™s exiled people. 
>
><sup>3</sup> He heals the brokenhearted and bandages their wounds. 
>
><sup>4</sup> He counts the number of the stars; he gives names to all of them. 
>
><sup>5</sup> Our Lord is great, vast in power; his understanding is infinite. 
>
><sup>6</sup> The LORD helps the oppressed but brings the wicked to the ground. 
>
><sup>7</sup> Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving; play the lyre to our God, 
>
><sup>8</sup> who covers the sky with clouds, prepares rain for the earth, and causes grass to grow on the hills. 
>
><sup>9</sup> He provides the animals with their food, and the young ravens what they cry for. 
>
><sup>10</sup> He is not impressed by the strength of a horse; he does not value the power of a warrior. 
>
><sup>11</sup> The LORD values those who fear him, those who put their hope in his faithful love. 
>
><sup>12</sup> Exalt the LORD, Jerusalem; praise your God, Zion! 
>
><sup>13</sup> For he strengthens the bars of your city gates and blesses your children within you. 
>
><sup>14</sup> He endows your territory with prosperity; he satisfies you with the finest wheat. 
>
><sup>15</sup> He sends his command throughout the earth; his word runs swiftly. 
>
><sup>16</sup> He spreads snow like wool; he scatters frost like ashes; 
>
><sup>17</sup> he throws his hailstones like crumbs. Who can withstand his cold? 
>
><sup>18</sup> He sends his word and melts them; he unleashes his winds, and the water flows. 
>
><sup>19</sup> He declares his word to Jacob, his statutes and judgments to Israel. 
>
><sup>20</sup> He has not done this for every nation; they do not know his judgments. Hallelujah!
