## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

From your mouth
  no one can accuse us
  no one can condemn us
  no one can separate us
  from your precious love
  because you are for us
  no one can be against us
  because you have predestined us
  called us
  justified us
  and glorified us
  to be conformed to the image of your Son
  Jesus Christ our Lord.

You have given me salvation
  I know this
  because I behold
  your only begotten Son
  my Christ
  my Lord
  my King
  my Shepherd
  my Savior
  my Redeemer
  and my Rock.

Give me words to preach
  so I can proclaim
  your awesome name
  and what you have done
  for your people.

Amen.
