# Psalm 27

> Of David. 
>
><sup>1</sup> The LORD is my light and my salvation— whom should I fear? The LORD is the stronghold of my life— whom should I dread? 
>
><sup>2</sup> When evildoers came against me to devour my flesh, my foes and my enemies stumbled and fell. 
>
><sup>3</sup> Though an army deploys against me, my heart will not be afraid; though a war breaks out against me, I will still be confident. 
>
><sup>4</sup> I have asked one thing from the LORD; it is what I desire: to dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, gazing on the beauty of the LORD and seeking him in his temple. 
>
><sup>5</sup> For he will conceal me in his shelter in the day of adversity; he will hide me under the cover of his tent; he will set me high on a rock. 
>
><sup>6</sup> Then my head will be high above my enemies around me; I will offer sacrifices in his tent with shouts of joy. I will sing and make music to the LORD. 
>
><sup>7</sup> LORD, hear my voice when I call; be gracious to me and answer me. 
>
><sup>8</sup> My heart says this about you: “Seek his face.” LORD, I will seek your face. 
>
><sup>9</sup> Do not hide your face from me; do not turn your servant away in anger. You have been my helper; do not leave me or abandon me, God of my salvation. 
>
><sup>10</sup> Even if my father and mother abandon me, the LORD cares for me. 
>
><sup>11</sup> Because of my adversaries, show me your way, LORD, and lead me on a level path. 
>
><sup>12</sup> Do not give me over to the will of my foes, for false witnesses rise up against me, breathing violence. 
>
><sup>13</sup> I am certain that I will see the LORD’s goodness in the land of the living. 
>
><sup>14</sup> Wait for the LORD; be strong, and let your heart be courageous. Wait for the LORD.
