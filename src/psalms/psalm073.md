# Praying Through: Psalm 73 Heart

## The Psalm

>Psalm 73  
><sup></sup> A psalm of Asaph. 
>
><sup>1</sup> God is indeed good to Israel, to the pure in heart. 
>
><sup>2</sup> But as for me, my feet almost slipped; my steps nearly went astray. 
>
><sup>3</sup> For I envied the arrogant; I saw the prosperity of the wicked. 
>
><sup>4</sup> They have an easy time until they die, and their bodies are well fed. 
>
><sup>5</sup> They are not in trouble like others; they are not afflicted like most people. 
>
><sup>6</sup> Therefore, pride is their necklace, and violence covers them like a garment. 
>
><sup>7</sup> Their eyes bulge out from fatness; the imaginations of their hearts run wild. 
>
><sup>8</sup> They mock, and they speak maliciously; they arrogantly threaten oppression. 
>
><sup>9</sup> They set their mouths against heaven, and their tongues strut across the earth. 
>
><sup>10</sup> Therefore his people turn to them and drink in their overflowing words. 
>
><sup>11</sup> The wicked say, “How can God know? Does the Most High know everything?” 
>
><sup>12</sup> Look at them—the wicked! They are always at ease, and they increase their wealth. 
>
><sup>13</sup> Did I purify my heart and wash my hands in innocence for nothing? 
>
><sup>14</sup> For I am afflicted all day long and punished every morning. 
>
><sup>15</sup> If I had decided to say these things aloud, I would have betrayed your people. 
>
><sup>16</sup> When I tried to understand all this, it seemed hopeless 
>
><sup>17</sup> until I entered God’s sanctuary. Then I understood their destiny. 
>
><sup>18</sup> Indeed, you put them in slippery places; you make them fall into ruin. 
>
><sup>19</sup> How suddenly they become a desolation! They come to an end, swept away by terrors. 
>
><sup>20</sup> Like one waking from a dream, Lord, when arising, you will despise their image. 
>
><sup>21</sup> When I became embittered and my innermost being was wounded, 
>
><sup>22</sup> I was stupid and didn’t understand; I was an unthinking animal toward you. 
>
><sup>23</sup> Yet I am always with you; you hold my right hand. 
>
><sup>24</sup> You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will take me up in glory. 
>
><sup>25</sup> Who do I have in heaven but you? And I desire nothing on earth but you. 
>
><sup>26</sup> My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart, my portion forever. 
>
><sup>27</sup> Those far from you will certainly perish; you destroy all who are unfaithful to you. 
>
><sup>28</sup> But as for me, God’s presence is my good. I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, so I can tell about all you do.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Heart
</div>

I have spent most of my life  
* chasing after the world  
* wanting what the world is offering  
* and falling for the temptations of Satan  
* every single time.

I yearn after my own lusts  
* and my desires  
* because surely this will make me secure  
* surely this will keep me safe  
* surely that this will protect my heart from all harm.

But it didn't  
* and my world fell apart  
* and I had nothing  
* and I was nothing.

I have been foolish and ignorant before you

But how did you respond?  
* You saved me  
* and lifted me to you  
* and I stare into your eyes  
* and I cannot leave you  
* even if I tried.

Who else do I have in this life?  
* Where else do I go?  
* Where else does my salvation come from?  
* Who else has the words for eternal life?

Just you  
* my only, only Lord Jesus.

Amen.
