# Psalm 34

>Concerning David, when he pretended to be insane in the presence of Abimelech, who drove him out, and he departed. 
>
><sup>1</sup> I will bless the LORD at all times; his praise will always be on my lips. 
>
><sup>2</sup> I will boast in the LORD; the humble will hear and be glad. 
>
><sup>3</sup> Proclaim the LORDâ€™s greatness with me; let us exalt his name together. 
>
><sup>4</sup> I sought the LORD, and he answered me and rescued me from all my fears. 
>
><sup>5</sup> Those who look to him are radiant with joy; their faces will never be ashamed. 
>
><sup>6</sup> This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him and saved him from all his troubles. 
>
><sup>7</sup> The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear him, and rescues them. 
>
><sup>8</sup> Taste and see that the LORD is good. How happy is the person who takes refuge in him! 
>
><sup>9</sup> You who are his holy ones, fear the LORD, for those who fear him lack nothing. 
>
><sup>10</sup> Young lions lack food and go hungry, but those who seek the LORD will not lack any good thing. 
>
><sup>11</sup> Come, children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the LORD. 
>
><sup>12</sup> Who is someone who desires life, loving a long life to enjoy what is good? 
>
><sup>13</sup> Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from deceitful speech. 
>
><sup>14</sup> Turn away from evil and do what is good; seek peace and pursue it. 
>
><sup>15</sup> The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous, and his ears are open to their cry for help. 
>
><sup>16</sup> The face of the LORD is set against those who do what is evil, to remove all memory of them from the earth. 
>
><sup>17</sup> The righteous cry out, and the LORD hears, and rescues them from all their troubles. 
>
><sup>18</sup> The LORD is near the brokenhearted; he saves those crushed in spirit. 
>
><sup>19</sup> One who is righteous has many adversities, but the LORD rescues him from them all. 
>
><sup>20</sup> He protects all his bones; not one of them is broken. 
>
><sup>21</sup> Evil brings death to the wicked, and those who hate the righteous will be punished. 
>
><sup>22</sup> The LORD redeems the life of his servants, and all who take refuge in him will not be punished.
