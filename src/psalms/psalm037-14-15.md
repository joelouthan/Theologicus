# Praying Through: Psalm 37:14-15

## The Psalm

>Psalm 37 (CSB)

>
><sup>15</sup> Their swords will enter their own hearts, and their bows will be broken. 

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My One Avenger
</div>

When I am hurt
* when people hurt me
* when they attack me
* when they do their worse.

Help me to take no offense
* to take my pain to you, O God
* because on your Son
* is all of my sin
* treason
* disease
* pain
* and suffering
* That belongs to you.

I will no longer live 
* on offense
* by angry
* by destruction
* by pain
* bv sin
* because you have called me to live in your Son alone

Be my love, O Lord.

I love you.

Amen
