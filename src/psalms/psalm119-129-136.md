# Praying Through: Psalm 119:129-136

## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:129–136 (CSB)  
><sup>129</sup> Your decrees are wondrous; therefore I obey them. 
>
><sup>130</sup> The revelation of your words brings light and gives understanding to the inexperienced. 
>
><sup>131</sup> I open my mouth and pant because I long for your commands. 
>
><sup>132</sup> Turn to me and be gracious to me, as is your practice toward those who love your name. 
>
><sup>133</sup> Make my steps steady through your promise; don’t let any sin dominate me. 
>
><sup>134</sup> Redeem me from human oppression, and I will keep your precepts. 
>
><sup>135</sup> Make your face shine on your servant, and teach me your statutes. 
>
><sup>136</sup> My eyes pour out streams of tears because people do not follow your instruction.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

You have not simply given us
* a list of commands
* an arbitary set of rules
* in your law
* you have shown us
* in part but truly
* who you are
* what you are like
* you have one aspect of your character.

You shown us
* that this is who you are
* and that to get to you
* we need to be like you
* and you made us
* and we sinned against you
* so now we cannot come to you.

But your law
* and your prophets
* said that you would come to us
* and you did not need to bend your law
* break your law
* or change your law
* you just sent your only begotten Son
* to perfectly obey
* and fulfill your law.

And now
* we now see you
* and truly know you
* you are holy
* and compassionate
* you are righteous
* and merciful
* you are just
* and gracious.

And I know this
* because I have your Son
* my Lord
* Jesus Christ
* my Savior.

Be exalted today.

Amen.
