# Praying Through: Psalm 119:81-88

## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:81–88 (CSB)  
><sup>81</sup> I long for your salvation; I put my hope in your word. 
>
><sup>82</sup> My eyes grow weary looking for what you have promised; I ask, “When will you comfort me?” 
>
><sup>83</sup> Though I have become like a wineskin dried by smoke, I do not forget your statutes. 
>
><sup>84</sup> How many days must your servant wait? When will you execute judgment on my persecutors? 
>
><sup>85</sup> The arrogant have dug pits for me; they violate your instruction. 
>
><sup>86</sup> All your commands are true; people persecute me with lies—help me! 
>
><sup>87</sup> They almost ended my life on earth, but I did not abandon your precepts. 
>
><sup>88</sup> Give me life in accordance with your faithful love, and I will obey the decree you have spoken.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

In my deepest darkest pain
* in my greatest despair
* my blackest night
* then only thing
* that kept me alive
* was your word
* your law
* your gospel

When I had nothing else
* I did not even want my life
* all I could remember
* was your promise
* that you will bring me
* all the way home

And the only way I knew that
* is because you made your home in me
* your Spirit dwells in me
* you Son bled and died for me.

You spared my life on that day
* but you did not spare your Son
* so that I can be with you
* forever and ever.

I will praise you until I die.

Amen.
