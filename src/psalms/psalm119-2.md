## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:2 (CSB) Happy are those who keep his decrees and seek him with all their heart.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

I have never been with you  
* I have never sought you  
* I have never chased after you  
* I have never wanted you.

But you have have been with me  
* you have sought me out  
* you have ran after me  
* you have loved me from always  
* you have preserved me  
* you have kept me close.

When I have sinned  
* and I have strayed  
* you held on tighter.

Be glorified in my life  
* today.

Amen.
