## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:65â€“72 (CSB)  
><sup>65</sup> LORD, you have treated your servant well, just as you promised. 
>
><sup>66</sup> Teach me good judgment and discernment, for I rely on your commands. 
>
><sup>67</sup> Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I keep your word. 
>
><sup>68</sup> You are good, and you do what is good; teach me your statutes. 
>
><sup>69</sup> The arrogant have smeared me with lies, but I obey your precepts with all my heart. 
>
><sup>70</sup> Their hearts are hard and insensitive, but I delight in your instruction. 
>
><sup>71</sup> It was good for me to be afflicted so that I could learn your statutes. 
>
><sup>72</sup> Instruction from your lips is better for me than thousands of gold and silver pieces.
