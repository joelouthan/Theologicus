# Praying Through: Psalm 119:29

## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:29 Keep me from the way of deceit and graciously give me your instruction.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

Continuously
* you know much I wonder
* and I know I am made from dust
* because you know
* you give grace and mercy
* faith and repentance
* your Holy Spirit
* your only begotten Son
* alone
* will bring me all the way home.

Be glorified today.

Amen.
