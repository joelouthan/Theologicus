# Praying Through: Psalm 119:29

## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:29 (CSB) Keep me from the way of deceit and graciously give me your instruction.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

Continuously
  you know much I wonder
  and I know I am made from dust
  because you know
  you give grace and mercy
  faith and repentance
  your Holy Spirit
  your only begotten Son
  alone
  will bring me all the way home.

Be glorified today.

Amen.
