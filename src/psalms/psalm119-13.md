# Praying Through: Psalm 119:13

## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:13 (CSB) With my lips I proclaim all the judgments from your mouth.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

I know of your justice
* and your terrifying wrath
* you do as you please
* in your good will
* you strike down the wicked
* and you perish your foes.

With my mouth
* I tremble to speak
* of your judgments
* for I am a sinner
* and I deserve your wrath.

Nevertheless
* I am obligated
* to speak to those
* who face your wrath
* for they do not believe
* to call upon the name of the Lord
* to look up upon him
* and see his lovely face
* and believe in him
* and they will be saved.

I will speak of your good news
* of your tender mercies
* of your grace leveling on grace
* of your steadfast love
* to your people
* whom you have saved
* from your just wrath to come.

Spirit
* give me the words
* because I am lacking in speech
* give me a tender heart
* to the captives
* and a shepherding heart
* to those who are precious in your sight.

Amen.
