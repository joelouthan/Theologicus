## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Lord  
</div>

For all of my days  
  I will bless your name  
  Lord God my Father  
  from everlasting to everlasting.

Yours alone  
  is the greatness  
  and the power  
  and the glory  
  and the victory  
  and the majesty  
  for everything that exists  
  in the heaven  
  in the earth  
  and under the earth  
  is yours.

Yours is the kingdom  
  and you are exalted  
  far above  
  all other gods.

Whatever provision  
  and riches  
  and honor  
  and glory  
  that I am might hold  
  has come completely  
  and totally  
  from you alone.

Any ounce of power  
  and strength  
  and might  
  and grace  
  that I think I have  
  is from your hand  
  you alone make great  
  and give strength to all.

Because you are God alone  
  I thank you  
  and I praise your  
  glorious name  
  forever.

Who am I  
  and what are these people  
  who think we can give something to you  
  when you do not need anything  
  and you are not served by our hands and strength.

For everything  
  comes from you alone  
  and we are only giving  
  what you have given us.

We pilgrims  
  and aliens  
  sojourning  
  and wandering  
  through this earht  
  just like all of our forefathers before us  
  Our days here  
  are like a shadow  
  and we are desperately  
  without hope.

I know you  
  you have seen me  
  from eternity past  
  and found me wanting  
  and dead  
  and running from you  
  and you are only pleased  
  with what is right  
  so you have sent your Son  
  to live so I could die  
  and to die so that I can live  
  and to live again so I can be with you  
  and to ascend so I can be in his charge  
  for all of my days  
  with you.

Lord God  
  of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,
  my fathers,
  make your home in me  
  and your Spirit to dwell in me  
  because Christ lives in me  
  and bring me  
  all the way home.

For yours alone  
  is the kingdom  
  and the power  
  and the glory  
  forever and ever.

Amen.
