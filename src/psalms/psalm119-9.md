# Praying Through: Psalm 119:9

## The Psalm

>Psalms 119:9 (CSB) How can a young man keep his way pure? By keeping your word.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

How can I keep my way pure?
* By trusting in you
* For your word says
* You are the way, the truth, and the life
* and
* if I believe the Son of God
* I will live forever
* if I do not believe the Son of God
* then your wrath remains upon me.

But then how do I believe in the Son *perfectly?*
* I cannot
* because I was born into sin
* I have to have someone who was born perfectly
* lived perfectly
* died without sin
* and because doing so
* rose again from death
* for me
* because I cannot believe perfectly.

But the same Christ
* whom I must trust for eternal life
* is the same Christ
* who lived and died for me.

Praise be the name of the Lord
* who is alone
* is worth to be praised and adored.

Amen.
