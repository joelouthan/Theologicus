# Praying Through: Psalm 130

## The Psalm

>Psalm 130 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A song of ascents. 
>
><sup>1</sup> Out of the depths I call to you, LORD! 
>
><sup>2</sup> Lord, listen to my voice; let your ears be attentive to my cry for help. 
>
><sup>3</sup> LORD, if you kept an account of iniquities, Lord, who could stand? 
>
><sup>4</sup> But with you there is forgiveness, so that you may be revered. 
>
><sup>5</sup> I wait for the LORD; I wait and put my hope in his word. 
>
><sup>6</sup> I wait for the Lord more than watchmen for the morningâ€” more than watchmen for the morning. 
>
><sup>7</sup> Israel, put your hope in the LORD. For there is faithful love with the LORD, and with him is redemption in abundance. 
>
><sup>8</sup> And he will redeem Israel from all its iniquities.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Rescuer
</div>

When I have called to you, O Lord,
* you have answered me
* you have listened to my voice.

I cry for help
* I scream for salvation
* and I need your Son
* you answer has always been
* yes and Amen.

I have sought your face
* and you have never denied me
* you have never turned me away
* you have never said no to me.

You are mine
* and I am yours
* forevermore.

Amen.
