# Praying Through: Psalm 143

## The Psalm

>Psalm 143  
><sup></sup> A psalm of David. 
>
><sup>1</sup> LORD, hear my prayer. In your faithfulness listen to my plea, and in your righteousness answer me. 
>
><sup>2</sup> Do not bring your servant into judgment, for no one alive is righteous in your sight. 
>
><sup>3</sup> For the enemy has pursued me, crushing me to the ground, making me live in darkness like those long dead. 
>
><sup>4</sup> My spirit is weak within me; my heart is overcome with dismay. 
>
><sup>5</sup> I remember the days of old; I meditate on all you have done; I reflect on the work of your hands. 
>
><sup>6</sup> I spread out my hands to you; I am like parched land before you. Selah 
>
><sup>7</sup> Answer me quickly, LORD; my spirit fails. Don’t hide your face from me, or I will be like those going down to the Pit. 
>
><sup>8</sup> Let me experience your faithful love in the morning, for I trust in you. Reveal to me the way I should go because I appeal to you. 
>
><sup>9</sup> Rescue me from my enemies, LORD; I come to you for protection. 
>
><sup>10</sup> Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. May your gracious Spirit lead me on level ground. 
>
><sup>11</sup> For your name’s sake, LORD, let me live. In your righteousness deliver me from trouble, 
>
><sup>12</sup> and in your faithful love destroy my enemies. Wipe out all those who attack me, for I am your servant.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Only Answered Prayer
</div>

The world had left me for dead
* discarded
* thrown away.

Satan had me in his teeth
* and I was ravaged
* beyond recognition
* and beyond any reasonable healing

Demons continuously pop shots
* their arrows
* tear my flesh
* and my heart
* and straight through my mind
* and my will.

I was left for dead.

I was dead.

I died.

But in the midst of my wickedness, my sin, my worthlessness, my trespass, my evil--

You saw me
* all of my sin
* all of it
* the very base of my heart
* and you saved me.

You saved me.

You alone loved me and cared for me.

You alone are worthy of all praise.

You are my Lord and God.

Amen.
