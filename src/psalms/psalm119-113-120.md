## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:113–120 (CSB)  
><sup>113</sup> I hate those who are double-minded, but I love your instruction. 
>
><sup>114</sup> You are my shelter and my shield; I put my hope in your word. 
>
><sup>115</sup> Depart from me, you evil ones, so that I may obey my God’s commands. 
>
><sup>116</sup> Sustain me as you promised, and I will live; do not let me be ashamed of my hope. 
>
><sup>117</sup> Sustain me so that I can be safe and always be concerned about your statutes. 
>
><sup>118</sup> You reject all who stray from your statutes, for their deceit is a lie. 
>
><sup>119</sup> You remove all the wicked on earth as if they were dross from metal; therefore, I love your decrees. 
>
><sup>120</sup> I tremble in awe of you; I fear your judgments.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

I need not to worry
* while I remain here
* for you will be with me
* guide me
* and confort me.

Whatever fells me
* you will keep me close
* and bring me all the way home
* so I can be with you
* forever.

I love you Lord
* be glorified
* today.

Amen.
