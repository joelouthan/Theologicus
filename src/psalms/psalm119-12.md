## The Psalm

>Psalms 119:12 (CSB) LORD, may you be blessed; teach me your statutes.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

First of all
* I could not possibly understand
* your word
* unless you made me a new creation
* given me your Son
* your Spirit
* your heart
* and a renew mind
* for that
* I will praise your holy name.

And you have been so good
* to give me
* teachers before me
* to instruct me in all your ways
* for that
* I will praise your holy name.

And you have given me
* vast provisions
* to purchase all the books
* not in all of my life
* would I enjoy reading and studying
* for that
* I will praise your holy name.

Put your word
* in my heart
* so I will not sin
* against your holy name.

Amen.
