# Praying Through: Psalm 107 All-in-all

## The Psalm

>Psalm 107 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his faithful love endures forever. 
>
><sup>2</sup> Let the redeemed of the LORD proclaim that he has redeemed them from the power of the foe 
>
><sup>3</sup> and has gathered them from the lands— from the east and the west, from the north and the south. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Some wandered in the desolate wilderness, finding no way to a city where they could live. 
>
><sup>5</sup> They were hungry and thirsty; their spirits failed within them. 
>
><sup>6</sup> Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble; he rescued them from their distress. 
>
><sup>7</sup> He led them by the right path to go to a city where they could live. 
>
><sup>8</sup> Let them give thanks to the LORD for his faithful love and his wondrous works for all humanity. 
>
><sup>9</sup> For he has satisfied the thirsty and filled the hungry with good things. 
>
><sup>10</sup> Others sat in darkness and gloom— prisoners in cruel chains— 
>
><sup>11</sup> because they rebelled against God’s commands and despised the counsel of the Most High. 
>
><sup>12</sup> He broke their spirits with hard labor; they stumbled, and there was no one to help. 
>
><sup>13</sup> Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble; he saved them from their distress. 
>
><sup>14</sup> He brought them out of darkness and gloom and broke their chains apart. 
>
><sup>15</sup> Let them give thanks to the LORD for his faithful love and his wondrous works for all humanity. 
>
><sup>16</sup> For he has broken down the bronze gates and cut through the iron bars. 
>
><sup>17</sup> Fools suffered affliction because of their rebellious ways and their iniquities. 
>
><sup>18</sup> They loathed all food and came near the gates of death. 
>
><sup>19</sup> Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble; he saved them from their distress. 
>
><sup>20</sup> He sent his word and healed them; he rescued them from their traps. 
>
><sup>21</sup> Let them give thanks to the LORD for his faithful love and his wondrous works for all humanity. 
>
><sup>22</sup> Let them offer thanksgiving sacrifices and announce his works with shouts of joy. 
>
><sup>23</sup> Others went to sea in ships, conducting trade on the vast water. 
>
><sup>24</sup> They saw the LORD’s works, his wondrous works in the deep. 
>
><sup>25</sup> He spoke and raised a stormy wind that stirred up the waves of the sea. 
>
><sup>26</sup> Rising up to the sky, sinking down to the depths, their courage melting away in anguish, 
>
><sup>27</sup> they reeled and staggered like a drunkard, and all their skill was useless. 
>
><sup>28</sup> Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and he brought them out of their distress. 
>
><sup>29</sup> He stilled the storm to a whisper, and the waves of the sea were hushed. 
>
><sup>30</sup> They rejoiced when the waves grew quiet. Then he guided them to the harbor they longed for. 
>
><sup>31</sup> Let them give thanks to the LORD for his faithful love and his wondrous works for all humanity. 
>
><sup>32</sup> Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people and praise him in the council of the elders. 
>
><sup>33</sup> He turns rivers into desert, springs into thirsty ground, 
>
><sup>34</sup> and fruitful land into salty wasteland, because of the wickedness of its inhabitants. 
>
><sup>35</sup> He turns a desert into a pool, dry land into springs. 
>
><sup>36</sup> He causes the hungry to settle there, and they establish a city where they can live. 
>
><sup>37</sup> They sow fields and plant vineyards that yield a fruitful harvest. 
>
><sup>38</sup> He blesses them, and they multiply greatly; he does not let their livestock decrease. 
>
><sup>39</sup> When they are diminished and are humbled by cruel oppression and sorrow, 
>
><sup>40</sup> he pours contempt on nobles and makes them wander in a trackless wasteland. 
>
><sup>41</sup> But he lifts the needy out of their suffering and makes their families multiply like flocks. 
>
><sup>42</sup> The upright see it and rejoice, and all injustice shuts its mouth. 
>
><sup>43</sup> Let whoever is wise pay attention to these things and consider the LORD’s acts of faithful love.

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Lord
</div>

You are my forever  
* Jesus  
* Lamb of God  
* and only your name  
* is worthy of praise  
* forever.

You are my covenant  
* my rescuer  
* my redeemer  
* my portion  
* and my destiny.

Who is like you  
* O Lord  
* that while my own sins  
* and the sins of others  
* keep seeking my death  
* and despair,
* you keep pulling me out  
* and bringing me closer  
* to your heart?

You have rescued me  
* not just seven  
* but beyond seventy times seven.

Who is like you, O My God?  
* I will worship you  
* for all of my days.
* I will praise your holy name  
* with all that is in me  
* I will bless your name  
* forever.

Amen.
