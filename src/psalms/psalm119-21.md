# Praying Through: Psalm 119:21

## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:21 (CSB) You rebuke the arrogant, the ones under a curse, who wander from your commands.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

I am that beast before you
* I am that arrogant
* I war against you
* and sin continuously against you
* the only God

And I still do
* I love you
* and I love your word
* but I still stumble

Nonetheless
* you have gave me your word
* your Spirit
* and your Son
* and you have given me
* life
* hope
* faith
* love
* and repentance.

I was a dead man before
* but I am alive to you
* all because of what your Son
* has done for me.

I will praise you until I die.

Amen.
