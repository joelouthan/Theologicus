# Praying Through: Psalm 71 Refuge

## The Psalm

>Psalm 71 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> LORD, I seek refuge in you; let me never be disgraced. 
>
><sup>2</sup> In your justice, rescue and deliver me; listen closely to me and save me. 
>
><sup>3</sup> Be a rock of refuge for me, where I can always go. Give the command to save me, for you are my rock and fortress. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Deliver me, my God, from the power of the wicked, from the grasp of the unjust and oppressive. 
>
><sup>5</sup> For you are my hope, Lord GOD, my confidence from my youth. 
>
><sup>6</sup> I have leaned on you from birth; you took me from my mother’s womb. My praise is always about you. 
>
><sup>7</sup> I am like a miraculous sign to many, and you are my strong refuge. 
>
><sup>8</sup> My mouth is full of praise and honor to you all day long. 
>
><sup>9</sup> Don’t discard me in my old age. As my strength fails, do not abandon me. 
>
><sup>10</sup> For my enemies talk about me, and those who spy on me plot together, 
>
><sup>11</sup> saying, “God has abandoned him; chase him and catch him, for there is no one to rescue him.” 
>
><sup>12</sup> God, do not be far from me; my God, hurry to help me. 
>
><sup>13</sup> May my adversaries be disgraced and destroyed; may those who intend to harm me be covered with disgrace and humiliation. 
>
><sup>14</sup> But I will hope continually and will praise you more and more. 
>
><sup>15</sup> My mouth will tell about your righteousness and your salvation all day long, though I cannot sum them up. 
>
><sup>16</sup> I come because of the mighty acts of the Lord GOD; I will proclaim your righteousness, yours alone. 
>
><sup>17</sup> God, you have taught me from my youth, and I still proclaim your wondrous works. 
>
><sup>18</sup> Even while I am old and gray, God, do not abandon me, while I proclaim your power to another generation, your strength to all who are to come. 
>
><sup>19</sup> Your righteousness reaches the heights, God, you who have done great things; God, who is like you? 
>
><sup>20</sup> You caused me to experience many troubles and misfortunes, but you will revive me again. You will bring me up again, even from the depths of the earth. 
>
><sup>21</sup> You will increase my honor and comfort me once again. 
>
><sup>22</sup> Therefore, I will praise you with a harp for your faithfulness, my God; I will sing to you with a lyre, Holy One of Israel. 
>
><sup>23</sup> My lips will shout for joy when I sing praise to you because you have redeemed me. 
>
><sup>24</sup> Therefore, my tongue will proclaim your righteousness all day long, for those who intend to harm me will be disgraced and confounded.
