# Praying Through: Psalm 131

## The Psalm

>Psalm 131 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A song of ascents. Of David. 
>
><sup>1</sup> LORD, my heart is not proud; my eyes are not haughty. I do not get involved with things too great or too wondrous for me. 
>
><sup>2</sup> Instead, I have calmed and quieted my soul like a weaned child with its mother; my soul is like a weaned child. 
>
><sup>3</sup> Israel, put your hope in the LORD, both now and forever.
