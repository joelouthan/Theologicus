# Praying Through: Psalm 149

## The Psalm

>Psalm 149 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> Hallelujah! Sing to the LORD a new song, his praise in the assembly of the faithful. 
>
><sup>2</sup> Let Israel celebrate its Maker; let the children of Zion rejoice in their King. 
>
><sup>3</sup> Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with tambourine and lyre. 
>
><sup>4</sup> For the LORD takes pleasure in his people; he adorns the humble with salvation. 
>
><sup>5</sup> Let the faithful celebrate in triumphal glory; let them shout for joy on their beds. 
>
><sup>6</sup> Let the exaltation of God be in their mouths and a double-edged sword in their hands, 
>
><sup>7</sup> inflicting vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples, 
>
><sup>8</sup> binding their kings with chains and their dignitaries with iron shackles, 
>
><sup>9</sup> carrying out the judgment decreed against them. This honor is for all his faithful people. Hallelujah!

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Only King
</div>

Bring me low
* much lower
* cut me down
* humble me
* make me small.

Make me like your Son
* my King Jesus
* and bring me all the way home.

Hallelujah!

Amen and amen!
