# Praying Through: Psalm 70 Rescuer

## The Psalm

>Psalm 70 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director. Of David. To bring remembrance. 
>
><sup>1</sup> God, hurry to rescue me. LORD, hurry to help me! 
>
><sup>2</sup> Let those who seek to kill me be disgraced and confounded; let those who wish me harm be turned back and humiliated. 
>
><sup>3</sup> Let those who say, “Aha, aha!” retreat because of their shame. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Let all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; let those who love your salvation continually say, “God is great!” 
>
><sup>5</sup> I am oppressed and needy; hurry to me, God. You are my help and my deliverer; LORD, do not delay.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Rescuer
</div>

How many times
* do I fall back into the depths of the ocean
* to drown in my own sin
* to return back to my vomit
* to die another death
* to run away from you?

* How many times
*  do you love me
*  do you care for me
*  do you keep me
*  do you find me
*  do you rescue me

How many stars are there?

How many grains of sand?

How many drops of ocean?

How many blades of grass?

How many waves of sun?

What is that number?

Doesn't compare
* to your unending love for me.

Amen.
