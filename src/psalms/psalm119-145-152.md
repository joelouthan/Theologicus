## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:145–152  
><sup>145</sup> I call with all my heart; answer me, LORD. I will obey your statutes. 
>
><sup>146</sup> I call to you; save me, and I will keep your decrees. 
>
><sup>147</sup> I rise before dawn and cry out for help; I put my hope in your word. 
>
><sup>148</sup> I am awake through each watch of the night to meditate on your promise. 
>
><sup>149</sup> In keeping with your faithful love, hear my voice. LORD, give me life in keeping with your justice.
