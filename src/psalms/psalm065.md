# Praying Through: Psalm 65

## The Psalm

>Psalm 65 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director. A psalm of David. A song. 
>
><sup>1</sup> Praise is rightfully yours, God, in Zion; vows to you will be fulfilled. 
>
><sup>2</sup> All humanity will come to you, the one who hears prayer. 
>
><sup>3</sup> Iniquities overwhelm me; only you can atone for our rebellions. 
>
><sup>4</sup> How happy is the one you choose and bring near to live in your courts! We will be satisfied with the goodness of your house, the holiness of your temple. 
>
><sup>5</sup> You answer us in righteousness, with awe-inspiring works, God of our salvation, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the distant seas. 
>
><sup>6</sup> You establish the mountains by your power; you are robed with strength. 
>
><sup>7</sup> You silence the roar of the seas, the roar of their waves, and the tumult of the nations. 
>
><sup>8</sup> Those who live far away are awed by your signs; you make east and west shout for joy. 
>
><sup>9</sup> You visit the earth and water it abundantly, enriching it greatly. Godâ€™s stream is filled with water, for you prepare the earth in this way, providing people with grain. 
>
><sup>10</sup> You soften it with showers and bless its growth, soaking its furrows and leveling its ridges. 
>
><sup>11</sup> You crown the year with your goodness; your carts overflow with plenty. 
>
><sup>12</sup> The wilderness pastures overflow, and the hills are robed with joy. 
>
><sup>13</sup> The pastures are clothed with flocks and the valleys covered with grain. They shout in triumph; indeed, they sing.
