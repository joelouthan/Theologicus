Worthy is the Lamb
</div>


There is none like you
  the Savior of my soul
  the Love of my heart
  the Giver of my salvation
  the Redeemer of my existence
  the Absorber of my just wrath
  the Remover of my sins
  the Adopter of this child
  the Mercy of my every morning
  the Grace upon your grace
  the Love that steadfastly me so.

I love you Lord
  and I will forever praise your holy name.
