# Praying Through: Psalm 62

## The Psalm

>Psalm 62 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director: according to Jeduthun. A psalm of David. 
>
><sup>1</sup> I am at rest in God alone; my salvation comes from him. 
>
><sup>2</sup> He alone is my rock and my salvation, my stronghold; I will never be shaken. 
>
><sup>3</sup> How long will you threaten a man? Will all of you attack as if he were a leaning wall or a tottering fence? 
>
><sup>4</sup> They only plan to bring him down from his high position. They take pleasure in lying; they bless with their mouths, but they curse inwardly. Selah 
>
><sup>5</sup> Rest in God alone, my soul, for my hope comes from him. 
>
><sup>6</sup> He alone is my rock and my salvation, my stronghold; I will not be shaken. 
>
><sup>7</sup> My salvation and glory depend on God, my strong rock. My refuge is in God. 
>
><sup>8</sup> Trust in him at all times, you people; pour out your hearts before him. God is our refuge. Selah 
>
><sup>9</sup> Common people are only a vapor; important people, an illusion. Together on a scale, they weigh less than a vapor. 
>
><sup>10</sup> Place no trust in oppression or false hope in robbery. If wealth increases, donâ€™t set your heart on it. 
>
><sup>11</sup> God has spoken once; I have heard this twice: strength belongs to God, 
>
><sup>12</sup> and faithful love belongs to you, Lord. For you repay each according to his works.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
You Are My Rest
</div>

Most of my life
* I have fought against you
* blasphemed your holy name
* was slave to my own lusts
* continue to hating everybody
* and including myself.

But with all of my life
* you set your affections upon me
* loved me with love I have never known
* gave me grace everywhere
* and was so merciful and kind towards me
* despite my anger and rage and sin against you

I still cannot believe
* that you would love me
* at my very worst
* in my darkest pain
* in my deepest shame
* you saw me
* knowing I was dead
* and brought me to life.

I need you, Lord
* now more than anything.

Be my love forever.

I love you.

Amen.
