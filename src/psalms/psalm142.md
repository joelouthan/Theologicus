# Praying Through: Psalm 142

## The Psalm

>Psalm 142 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A Maskil of David. When he was in the cave. A prayer. 
>
><sup>1</sup> I cry aloud to the LORD; I plead aloud to the LORD for mercy. 
>
><sup>2</sup> I pour out my complaint before him; I reveal my trouble to him. 
>
><sup>3</sup> Although my spirit is weak within me, you know my way. Along this path I travel they have hidden a trap for me. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Look to the right and see: no one stands up for me; there is no refuge for me; no one cares about me. 
>
><sup>5</sup> I cry to you, LORD; I say, “You are my shelter, my portion in the land of the living.” 
>
><sup>6</sup> Listen to my cry, for I am very weak. Rescue me from those who pursue me, for they are too strong for me. 
>
><sup>7</sup> Free me from prison so that I can praise your name. The righteous will gather around me because you deal generously with me.
