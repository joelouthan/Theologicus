## The Prayer

My Living Word

If I have kept your ways  
  I would have been happy  
  but I have not  
  because I was born wicked  
  led astray  
  in and of sin  
  far apart from you.

And sin continues to hunt me down  
  and stalk me  
  waiting to tear me to shred  
  my own sin  
  devours me from the inside out  
  infected my thoughts continuously  
  breaking my heart over and over again.

Nevertheless  
  you knew all of that  
  because you seen the depths of my soul  
  you have peered into my heart  
  and have seen nothing but depravity  
  weakness  
  frailty  
  sin  
  unholiness  
  unrighteousness.

My fathers  
  sin mightily  
  and I have inherited their worthless estate.

What shall I do?

Nothing  
  I can do nothing  
  I have nothing but all of my gross sin  
  this is my offering  
  my complete worst  
  my abomination  
  my sins against myself  
  others  
  You, O God.

You still know  
  that I would never come to you  
  never ask you for help  
  never seek out salvation  
  never repent of my sins  
  continue in my sin unto death.

But you gave me yourself  
  You came to me  
  You sent your Son to live and die for me  
  You sent your Spirit to raise me from the dead  
  you gave me your heart  
  all to do what?

To repent of my sins  
  to turn my wickedness  
  to turn to you  
  to run to you  
  to plead to you  
  to save me from my sins.

And you have  
  and you are  
  and you will  
  because I am yours  
  and you are mine  
  forever.
