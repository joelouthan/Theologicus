# Praying Through: Psalm 138

## The Psalm

>Psalm 138 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> Of David. 
>
><sup>1</sup> I will give you thanks with all my heart; I will sing your praise before the heavenly beings. 
>
><sup>2</sup> I will bow down toward your holy temple and give thanks to your name for your constant love and truth. You have exalted your name and your promise above everything else. 
>
><sup>3</sup> On the day I called, you answered me; you increased strength within me. 
>
><sup>4</sup> All the kings on earth will give you thanks, LORD, when they hear what you have promised. 
>
><sup>5</sup> They will sing of the LORD’s ways, for the LORD’s glory is great. 
>
><sup>6</sup> Though the LORD is exalted, he takes note of the humble; but he knows the haughty from a distance. 
>
><sup>7</sup> If I walk into the thick of danger, you will preserve my life from the anger of my enemies. You will extend your hand; your right hand will save me. 
>
><sup>8</sup> The LORD will fulfill his purpose for me. LORD, your faithful love endures forever; do not abandon the work of your hands.
