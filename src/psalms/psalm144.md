# Praying Through: Psalm 144

## The Psalm

>Psalm 144 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> Of David. 
>
><sup>1</sup> Blessed be the LORD, my rock who trains my hands for battle and my fingers for warfare. 
>
><sup>2</sup> He is my faithful love and my fortress, my stronghold and my deliverer. He is my shield, and I take refuge in him; he subdues my people under me. 
>
><sup>3</sup> LORD, what is a human that you care for him, a son of man that you think of him? 
>
><sup>4</sup> A human is like a breath; his days are like a passing shadow. 
>
><sup>5</sup> LORD, part your heavens and come down. Touch the mountains, and they will smoke. 
>
><sup>6</sup> Flash your lightning and scatter the foe; shoot your arrows and rout them. 
>
><sup>7</sup> Reach down from on high; rescue me from deep water, and set me free from the grasp of foreigners 
>
><sup>8</sup> whose mouths speak lies, whose right hands are deceptive. 
>
><sup>9</sup> God, I will sing a new song to you; I will play on a ten-stringed harp for youâ€” 
>
><sup>10</sup> the one who gives victory to kings, who frees his servant David from the deadly sword. 
>
><sup>11</sup> Set me free and rescue me from foreigners whose mouths speak lies, whose right hands are deceptive. 
>
><sup>12</sup> Then our sons will be like plants nurtured in their youth, our daughters, like corner pillars that are carved in the palace style. 
>
><sup>13</sup> Our storehouses will be full, supplying all kinds of produce; our flocks will increase by thousands and tens of thousands in our open fields. 
>
><sup>14</sup> Our cattle will be well fed. There will be no breach in the walls, no going into captivity, and no cry of lament in our public squares. 
>
><sup>15</sup> Happy are the people with such blessings. Happy are the people whose God is the LORD.
