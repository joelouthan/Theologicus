# Praying Through: Psalm 119:121-128

## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:121–128  
><sup>121</sup> I have done what is just and right; do not leave me to my oppressors. 
>
><sup>122</sup> Guarantee your servant’s well-being; do not let the arrogant oppress me. 
>
><sup>123</sup> My eyes grow weary looking for your salvation and for your righteous promise. 
>
><sup>124</sup> Deal with your servant based on your faithful love; teach me your statutes. 
>
><sup>125</sup> I am your servant; give me understanding so that I may know your decrees. 
>
><sup>126</sup> It is time for the LORD to act, for they have violated your instruction. 
>
><sup>127</sup> Since I love your commands more than gold, even the purest gold, 
>
><sup>128</sup> I carefully follow all your precepts and hate every false way.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

I know that there have been many of times
* that I have been left to my oppressors
* that it might have felt like you were not there
* that my heart was smashed
* my mind confused
* my spirit broken
* my body weak
* and I could not go on.

Yet, when I look back
* I see not how strong I was
* or how my circumstances changed
* but it was you alone
* that sustained my life
* that chosen that I would not leave this world
* and be with you then
* but you kept me here
* and you would be with me
* as I accomplished
* what you have set out for me to do.

Keep your servant
* in your faithful love
* whatever comes next
* just be with me, Lord
* and I will be okay.

Amen.
