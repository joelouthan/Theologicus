# Praying Through: Psalm 119:14

## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:14 (CSB) I rejoice in the way revealed by your decrees as much as in all riches.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

If I had nothing
* no provisions
* no wealth
* no home
* no food
* I would have everything
* because I have your Son.

Because when I die
* I will behold his lovely face
* and live with you
* all the days of my life.

I will celebrate
* because I belong to you
* and you belong to me
* forevermore.

Amen.
