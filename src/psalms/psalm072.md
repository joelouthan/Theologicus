# Praying Through: Psalm 72 King

## The Psalm

>Psalm 72 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> Of Solomon. 
>
><sup>1</sup> God, give your justice to the king and your righteousness to the kingâ€™s son. 
>
><sup>2</sup> He will judge your people with righteousness and your afflicted ones with justice. 
>
><sup>3</sup> May the mountains bring well-being to the people and the hills, righteousness. 
>
><sup>4</sup> May he vindicate the afflicted among the people, help the poor, and crush the oppressor. 
>
><sup>5</sup> May they fear you while the sun endures and as long as the moon, throughout all generations. 
>
><sup>6</sup> May the king be like rain that falls on the cut grass, like spring showers that water the earth. 
>
><sup>7</sup> May the righteous flourish in his days and well-being abound until the moon is no more. 
>
><sup>8</sup> May he rule from sea to sea and from the Euphrates to the ends of the earth. 
>
><sup>9</sup> May desert tribes kneel before him and his enemies lick the dust. 
>
><sup>10</sup> May the kings of Tarshish and the coasts and islands bring tribute, the kings of Sheba and Seba offer gifts. 
>
><sup>11</sup> Let all kings bow in homage to him, all nations serve him. 
>
><sup>12</sup> For he will rescue the poor who cry out and the afflicted who have no helper. 
>
><sup>13</sup> He will have pity on the poor and helpless and save the lives of the poor. 
>
><sup>14</sup> He will redeem them from oppression and violence, for their lives are precious in his sight. 
>
><sup>15</sup> May he live long! May gold from Sheba be given to him. May prayer be offered for him continually, and may he be blessed all day long. 
>
><sup>16</sup> May there be plenty of grain in the land; may it wave on the tops of the mountains. May its crops be like Lebanon. May people flourish in the cities like the grass of the field. 
>
><sup>17</sup> May his name endure forever; as long as the sun shines, may his fame increase. May all nations be blessed by him and call him blessed. 
>
><sup>18</sup> Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who alone does wonders. 
>
><sup>19</sup> Blessed be his glorious name forever; the whole earth is filled with his glory. Amen and amen. 
>
><sup>20</sup> The prayers of David son of Jesse are concluded.
