## The Psalm

>Psalm 103:18 (CSB) of those who keep his covenant, who remember to observe his precepts.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Lord
</div>

I have never kept your covenant
  I have never observed your precepts
  I have tried and failed
  I struggle and continue to fail
  I have fallen all the way short of your glory

But this covenant you have made
  you have made with not with me
  but for me
  and you made this promise
  with the only one who could keep it
  your only begotten Son
  Jesus Christ
  Son of God who is God
  forever past and forever future

You keep us
  because he alone has fulfilled the covenant
  he alone has kept the precepts
  and I am in him
  and he is in me
  forever

Blessed be your holy name forever and ever

Amen
