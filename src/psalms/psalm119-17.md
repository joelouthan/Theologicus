# Praying Through: Psalm 119:17

## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:17 (CSB) Deal generously with your servant so that I might live; then I will keep your word. 

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

Give me your Son  
  so I might live and never die!

Now you have my life  
  I will keep your work  
  I will not sin against you  
  because your Son's life is mine  
  and I belong to him  
  by your grace alone.

Amen
