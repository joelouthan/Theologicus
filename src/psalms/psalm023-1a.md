# Praying Through: Psalm 23:1a The Lord Is My Shepherd

## The Psalm

>Psalm 23:1a (CSB)   The LORD is my shepherd

## The Prayer



You are my Good Shepherd.
You fled the ninety-nine
    in order to come rescue me,
  when I could not possibly rescue myself.
You saved me
    from certain damnation,
  you’ve rescued me from the slaughter.
You’ve taken all of my sin,
  and you let the wrath of Father
  fall upon your heart
You bled out for me,
  so that I might live forever.
Lord, keep me in your care,
  I pray that you keep good shepherds
  to care and feed me.
  none that will run away
  at the first sight of danger
  none that will be swayed
  to and fro by every wind of doctrine
  but stay the course because
  you are their strength and resolve.
I praise your holy name ever.
