# Praying Through: Psalm 69 Savior

## The Psalm

>Psalm 69 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director: according to “The Lilies.” Of David. 
>
><sup>1</sup> Save me, God, for the water has risen to my neck. 
>
><sup>2</sup> I have sunk in deep mud, and there is no footing; I have come into deep water, and a flood sweeps over me. 
>
><sup>3</sup> I am weary from my crying; my throat is parched. My eyes fail, looking for my God. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Those who hate me without cause are more numerous than the hairs of my head; my deceitful enemies, who would destroy me, are powerful. Though I did not steal, I must repay. 
>
><sup>5</sup> God, you know my foolishness, and my guilty acts are not hidden from you. 
>
><sup>6</sup> Do not let those who put their hope in you be disgraced because of me, Lord GOD of Armies; do not let those who seek you be humiliated because of me, God of Israel. 
>
><sup>7</sup> For I have endured insults because of you, and shame has covered my face. 
>
><sup>8</sup> I have become a stranger to my brothers and a foreigner to my mother’s sons 
>
><sup>9</sup> because zeal for your house has consumed me, and the insults of those who insult you have fallen on me. 
>
><sup>10</sup> I mourned and fasted, but it brought me insults. 
>
><sup>11</sup> I wore sackcloth as my clothing, and I was a joke to them. 
>
><sup>12</sup> Those who sit at the city gate talk about me, and drunkards make up songs about me. 
>
><sup>13</sup> But as for me, LORD, my prayer to you is for a time of favor. In your abundant, faithful love, God, answer me with your sure salvation. 
>
><sup>14</sup> Rescue me from the miry mud; don’t let me sink. Let me be rescued from those who hate me and from the deep water. 
>
><sup>15</sup> Don’t let the floodwaters sweep over me or the deep swallow me up; don’t let the Pit close its mouth over me. 
>
><sup>16</sup> Answer me, LORD, for your faithful love is good. In keeping with your abundant compassion, turn to me. 
>
><sup>17</sup> Don’t hide your face from your servant, for I am in distress. Answer me quickly! 
>
><sup>18</sup> Come near to me and redeem me; ransom me because of my enemies. 
>
><sup>19</sup> You know the insults I endure— my shame and disgrace. You are aware of all my adversaries. 
>
><sup>20</sup> Insults have broken my heart, and I am in despair. I waited for sympathy, but there was none; for comforters, but found no one. 
>
><sup>21</sup> Instead, they gave me gall for my food, and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. 
>
><sup>22</sup> Let their table set before them be a snare, and let it be a trap for their allies. 
>
><sup>23</sup> Let their eyes grow too dim to see, and let their hips continually quake. 
>
><sup>24</sup> Pour out your rage on them, and let your burning anger overtake them. 
>
><sup>25</sup> Make their fortification desolate; may no one live in their tents. 
>
><sup>26</sup> For they persecute the one you struck and talk about the pain of those you wounded. 
>
><sup>27</sup> Charge them with crime on top of crime; do not let them share in your righteousness. 
>
><sup>28</sup> Let them be erased from the book of life and not be recorded with the righteous. 
>
><sup>29</sup> But as for me—poor and in pain— let your salvation protect me, God. 
>
><sup>30</sup> I will praise God’s name with song and exalt him with thanksgiving. 
>
><sup>31</sup> That will please the LORD more than an ox, more than a bull with horns and hooves. 
>
><sup>32</sup> The humble will see it and rejoice. You who seek God, take heart! 
>
><sup>33</sup> For the LORD listens to the needy and does not despise his own who are prisoners. 
>
><sup>34</sup> Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas and everything that moves in them, 
>
><sup>35</sup> for God will save Zion and build up the cities of Judah. They will live there and possess it. 
>
><sup>36</sup> The descendants of his servants will inherit it, and those who love his name will live in it.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
Savior
</div>

I sit in the darkness once again
I have been here before
this a quiet and cold place
where I can smell the sin
waiting for me to sleep.

All of the pain
all of the loss
all of the sin
that I have ever experienced
has brought me back to this place
and it is cold and dark
where I can almost make out the evil
waiting for me to lay down

My sickness
my sin
my disease
my brokenness
are now my companions

And every time
I come back here
I would be devoured
and eating to the near last bite
and you would come and get me
and keep my soul.

This time
this round
this year
I stay awake
alive
quick
strong
in this sadness
in this quiet
int his cold
because now you are my only companion
you are my beloved
you are my love
you are my God

Keep me
keep your son
don't let me perish.

But more so
just stay with me
just keep me with you
and I will always be okay
because I am yours.


Amen.
