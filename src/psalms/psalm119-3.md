## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

But I have have done everything wrong  
* where do I even begin  
* I was born in sin  
* I lived in filth  
* I knew sin since birth  
* I lived in depravity since I was a child  
* and I loved it  
* and it comforted me  
* and sin crushed me and grind my bones  
* left me ashamed and confused.

I continually sinned against you  
* I would even blasphemed your name and take it for granted.

How did you respond?

You saved me  
* from the bottomless depths of my wickedness  
* from the weight of my wretchedness  
* from the despair of my worthlessness  
* you saved me  
* and you loved me.

There is none like you  
* you are the only Holy One of God.

Amen.
