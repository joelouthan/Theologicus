# Praying Through: Psalm 119:20

## The Psalm

>Psalm 119:20 I am continually overcome with longing for your judgments.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

I need you to come quick  
* I know that you will come quickly  
* to judge the living and the dead  
* for when that happens  
* I will see your lovely face.

I know my sin  
* keeps me infinitely from your love  
* but it was in great love for me  
* that you came to me  
* to save me from my sin  
* that kept me away from you.

Come quickly  
* Lord Jesus.

Amen.
