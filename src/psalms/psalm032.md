# Psalm 32

><sup></sup> Of David. A Maskil. 
>
><sup>1</sup> How joyful is the one whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered! 
>
><sup>2</sup> How joyful is a person whom the LORD does not charge with iniquity and in whose spirit is no deceit! 
>
><sup>3</sup> When I kept silent, my bones became brittle from my groaning all day long. 
>
><sup>4</sup> For day and night your hand was heavy on me; my strength was drained as in the summer’s heat. Selah 
>
><sup>5</sup> Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not conceal my iniquity. I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the LORD,” and you forgave the guilt of my sin. Selah 
>
><sup>6</sup> Therefore let everyone who is faithful pray to you immediately. When great floodwaters come, they will not reach him. 
>
><sup>7</sup> You are my hiding place; you protect me from trouble. You surround me with joyful shouts of deliverance. Selah 
>
><sup>8</sup> I will instruct you and show you the way to go; with my eye on you, I will give counsel. 
>
><sup>9</sup> Do not be like a horse or mule, without understanding, that must be controlled with bit and bridle or else it will not come near you. 
>
><sup>10</sup> Many pains come to the wicked, but the one who trusts in the LORD will have faithful love surrounding him. 
>
><sup>11</sup> Be glad in the LORD and rejoice, you righteous ones; shout for joy, all you upright in heart.
