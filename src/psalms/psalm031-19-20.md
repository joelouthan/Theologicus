# Praying Through: Psalm 31:19-20

## The Psalm

>Psalm 31:19â€“20 (CSB)  
><sup>19</sup> How great is your goodness, which you have stored up for those who fear you. In the presence of everyone you have acted for those who take refuge in you. 
>
><sup>20</sup> You hide them in the protection of your presence; you conceal them in a shelter from human schemes, from quarrelsome tongues.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">The All Good</div>

My Lord,
* my life bears witness
* that you alone protect me
* shield me
* provide for me
* and place your loving arms
* wrapped around me.

You hold me like a child,
* for I am just as vulnerable
* and would be devoured by dogs
* if it was not for you.
I praise your holy name
* for you are Lord Most High.
* So be exalted
* in my life
* and with my words.
Thank you for sparing me
 and thank you for saving my life
 Thank you for shielding me
 from the world
 from sin
 from Satan and his demons
 and sparing me from hell
 and protecting me
 from your just wrath.

Have mercy on me,
* for all of my days
* and bring me home quickly
* so I can stare into your eyes
* for all of eternity.
Amen.
