## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Forever Love
</div>

You are the only one
* who has perfectly loved me
* cared for me
* and been there for me
* even in my darkest hour.

You were my Lord
* and my great God.

Thank you for loving me all the days of my life.

And one day, I will get to see you face to face
* and then
* I will rest
* because I have all of your love.

Amen.
