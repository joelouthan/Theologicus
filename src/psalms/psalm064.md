# Praying Through: Psalm 64

## The Psalm

>Psalm 64 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director. A psalm of David. 
>
><sup>1</sup> God, hear my voice when I am in anguish. Protect my life from the terror of the enemy. 
>
><sup>2</sup> Hide me from the scheming of wicked people, from the mob of evildoers, 
>
><sup>3</sup> who sharpen their tongues like swords and aim bitter words like arrows, 
>
><sup>4</sup> shooting from concealed places at the blameless. They shoot at him suddenly and are not afraid. 
>
><sup>5</sup> They adopt an evil plan; they talk about hiding traps and say, “Who will see them?” 
>
><sup>6</sup> They devise crimes and say, “We have perfected a secret plan.” The inner man and the heart are mysterious. 
>
><sup>7</sup> But God will shoot them with arrows; suddenly, they will be wounded. 
>
><sup>8</sup> They will be made to stumble; their own tongues work against them. All who see them will shake their heads. 
>
><sup>9</sup> Then everyone will fear and will tell about God’s work, for they will understand what he has done. 
>
><sup>10</sup> The righteous one rejoices in the LORD and takes refuge in him; all those who are upright in heart will offer praise.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
You Are My Goodness
</div>

The worst
* has absolutely befallen me
* I have already tasted death
* I have already lost everything
* two times over
* I have nothing

But you appeared
* and rescued me
* one million and one times over
* and you will forever do it again
* because you have set your love upon me
* and you will never let me go
* and you will keep me in your bosom
* all of my days.

If I have you
* and nothing on this earth
* then I have everything
* because nothing compares to you.

Because you have sent your Son
* for my sake
* you have given me everything
* and heaven and earth
* can give me nothing.

Amen.
