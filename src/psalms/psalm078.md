# Praying Through: Psalm 78 Remembrance

## The Psalm

>Psalm 78  
><sup></sup> A Maskil of Asaph. 
>
><sup>1</sup> My people, hear my instruction; listen to the words from my mouth. 
>
><sup>2</sup> I will declare wise sayings; I will speak mysteries from the past— 
>
><sup>3</sup> things we have heard and known and that our ancestors have passed down to us. 
>
><sup>4</sup> We will not hide them from their children, but will tell a future generation the praiseworthy acts of the LORD, his might, and the wondrous works he has performed. 
>
><sup>5</sup> He established a testimony in Jacob and set up a law in Israel, which he commanded our ancestors to teach to their children 
>
><sup>6</sup> so that a future generation— children yet to be born—might know. They were to rise and tell their children 
>
><sup>7</sup> so that they might put their confidence in God and not forget God’s works, but keep his commands. 
>
><sup>8</sup> Then they would not be like their ancestors, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation whose heart was not loyal and whose spirit was not faithful to God. 
>
><sup>9</sup> The Ephraimite archers turned back on the day of battle. 
>
><sup>10</sup> They did not keep God’s covenant and refused to live by his law. 
>
><sup>11</sup> They forgot what he had done, the wondrous works he had shown them. 
>
><sup>12</sup> He worked wonders in the sight of their ancestors in the land of Egypt, the territory of Zoan. 
>
><sup>13</sup> He split the sea and brought them across; the water stood firm like a wall. 
>
><sup>14</sup> He led them with a cloud by day and with a fiery light throughout the night. 
>
><sup>15</sup> He split rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink as abundant as the depths. 
>
><sup>16</sup> He brought streams out of the stone and made water flow down like rivers. 
>
><sup>17</sup> But they continued to sin against him, rebelling in the desert against the Most High. 
>
><sup>18</sup> They deliberately tested God, demanding the food they craved. 
>
><sup>19</sup> They spoke against God, saying, “Is God able to provide food in the wilderness? 
>
><sup>20</sup> Look! He struck the rock and water gushed out; torrents overflowed. But can he also provide bread or furnish meat for his people?” 
>
><sup>21</sup> Therefore, the LORD heard and became furious; then fire broke out against Jacob, and anger flared up against Israel 
>
><sup>22</sup> because they did not believe God or rely on his salvation. 
>
><sup>23</sup> He gave a command to the clouds above and opened the doors of heaven. 
>
><sup>24</sup> He rained manna for them to eat; he gave them grain from heaven. 
>
><sup>25</sup> People ate the bread of angels. He sent them an abundant supply of food. 
>
><sup>26</sup> He made the east wind blow in the skies and drove the south wind by his might. 
>
><sup>27</sup> He rained meat on them like dust, and winged birds like the sand of the seas. 
>
><sup>28</sup> He made them fall in the camp, all around the tents. 
>
><sup>29</sup> The people ate and were completely satisfied, for he gave them what they craved. 
>
><sup>30</sup> Before they had turned from what they craved, while the food was still in their mouths, 
>
><sup>31</sup> God’s anger flared up against them, and he killed some of their best men. He struck down Israel’s fit young men. 
>
><sup>32</sup> Despite all this, they kept sinning and did not believe his wondrous works. 
>
><sup>33</sup> He made their days end in futility, their years in sudden disaster. 
>
><sup>34</sup> When he killed some of them, the rest began to seek him; they repented and searched for God. 
>
><sup>35</sup> They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God, their Redeemer. 
>
><sup>36</sup> But they deceived him with their mouths, they lied to him with their tongues, 
>
><sup>37</sup> their hearts were insincere toward him, and they were unfaithful to his covenant. 
>
><sup>38</sup> Yet he was compassionate; he atoned for their iniquity and did not destroy them. He often turned his anger aside and did not unleash all his wrath. 
>
><sup>39</sup> He remembered that they were only flesh, a wind that passes and does not return. 
>
><sup>40</sup> How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and grieved him in the desert. 
>
><sup>41</sup> They constantly tested God and provoked the Holy One of Israel. 
>
><sup>42</sup> They did not remember his power shown on the day he redeemed them from the foe, 
>
><sup>43</sup> when he performed his miraculous signs in Egypt and his wonders in the territory of Zoan. 
>
><sup>44</sup> He turned their rivers into blood, and they could not drink from their streams. 
>
><sup>45</sup> He sent among them swarms of flies, which fed on them, and frogs, which devastated them. 
>
><sup>46</sup> He gave their crops to the caterpillar and the fruit of their labor to the locust. 
>
><sup>47</sup> He killed their vines with hail and their sycamore fig trees with a flood. 
>
><sup>48</sup> He handed over their livestock to hail and their cattle to lightning bolts. 
>
><sup>49</sup> He sent his burning anger against them: fury, indignation, and calamity— a band of deadly messengers. 
>
><sup>50</sup> He cleared a path for his anger. He did not spare them from death but delivered their lives to the plague. 
>
><sup>51</sup> He struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the first progeny of the tents of Ham. 
>
><sup>52</sup> He led his people out like sheep and guided them like a flock in the wilderness. 
>
><sup>53</sup> He led them safely, and they were not afraid; but the sea covered their enemies. 
>
><sup>54</sup> He brought them to his holy territory, to the mountain his right hand acquired. 
>
><sup>55</sup> He drove out nations before them. He apportioned their inheritance by lot and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents. 
>
><sup>56</sup> But they rebelliously tested the Most High God, for they did not keep his decrees. 
>
><sup>57</sup> They treacherously turned away like their ancestors; they became warped like a faulty bow. 
>
><sup>58</sup> They enraged him with their high places and provoked his jealousy with their carved images. 
>
><sup>59</sup> God heard and became furious; he completely rejected Israel. 
>
><sup>60</sup> He abandoned the tabernacle at Shiloh, the tent where he resided among mankind. 
>
><sup>61</sup> He gave up his strength to captivity and his splendor to the hand of a foe. 
>
><sup>62</sup> He surrendered his people to the sword because he was enraged with his heritage. 
>
><sup>63</sup> Fire consumed his chosen young men, and his young women had no wedding songs. 
>
><sup>64</sup> His priests fell by the sword, and the widows could not lament. 
>
><sup>65</sup> The Lord awoke as if from sleep, like a warrior from the effects of wine. 
>
><sup>66</sup> He beat back his foes; he gave them lasting disgrace. 
>
><sup>67</sup> He rejected the tent of Joseph and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim. 
>
><sup>68</sup> He chose instead the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loved. 
>
><sup>69</sup> He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth that he established forever. 
>
><sup>70</sup> He chose David his servant and took him from the sheep pens; 
>
><sup>71</sup> he brought him from tending ewes to be shepherd over his people Jacob— over Israel, his inheritance. 
>
><sup>72</sup> He shepherded them with a pure heart and guided them with his skillful hands.

Remembrance
</div>

Everything you have done
* in my life
* and the life of your people

Help me
* to remember you
* when I am weak
* and when I would perish
* you are the champion
* of the perishable.

You have come to save me
* and when I wander
* and lost again
* you will save me
* yet again.

Write your precious Scripture
* upon my heart
* so I might not sin
* against you
* you are my Rock and my Redeemer
* forever.

Amen.
