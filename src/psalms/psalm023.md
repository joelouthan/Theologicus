# Psalm 23

>A psalm of David. 
>
><sup>1</sup> The LORD is my shepherd; I have what I need. 
>
><sup>2</sup> He lets me lie down in green pastures; he leads me beside quiet waters. 
>
><sup>3</sup> He renews my life; he leads me along the right paths for his name’s sake. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Even when I go through the darkest valley, I fear no danger, for you are with me; your rod and your staff—they comfort me. 
>
><sup>5</sup> You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. 
>
><sup>6</sup> Only goodness and faithful love will pursue me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD as long as I live.
