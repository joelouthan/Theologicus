## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

Lord,
* Give me your word
* Speak to me
* and you have spoken to me
* because you gave me your word.

Write your word upon my heart
* You and your Son
* come live in my heart
* Your Spirit
* seals my heart
* and I will never sin against you
* because your Son has perfectly taken my sin
* and I have his perfect righteousness.

I have not heard enough of your voice
* I want to hear it all the day long
* because when you speak
* I have been risen from death
* of my sin and transgression
* into peace and life everlasting,
* with you,
* my King Jesus.

Today,
* be exalted.
* 
Forever.

Amen.
