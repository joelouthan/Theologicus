# Praying Through: Psalm 23:2b He Leads Me Beside Quiet Waters

## The Psalm

>Psalm 23:2b   he leads me beside quiet waters.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Lord
</div>

You are the fountain of true life.
I am dead without you. 
* It is not that 
* I can find this water on my own.
For I am lost
* and, my soul is dried-up and dead.
I have no wisdom, 
* strength, 
* or spirit to find you.

But you, O Lord, rescued me.

You have brought me into your life 
* and in your life alone, 
* I am <em>fully</em> alive.
My soul is no longer dried in sin 
* but restored, 
* covered, 
* and filled with your forever grace.

God, please keep me close 
* so that I stay refreshed 
* and satisfied in all of life.
