# Psalm 30

>A psalm; a dedication song for the house. Of David. 
>
><sup>1</sup> I will exalt you, LORD, because you have lifted me up and have not allowed my enemies to triumph over me. 
>
><sup>2</sup> LORD my God, I cried to you for help, and you healed me. 
>
><sup>3</sup> LORD, you brought me up from Sheol; you spared me from among those going down to the Pit. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Sing to the LORD, you his faithful ones, and praise his holy name. 
>
><sup>5</sup> For his anger lasts only a moment, but his favor, a lifetime. Weeping may stay overnight, but there is joy in the morning. 
>
><sup>6</sup> When I was secure, I said, “I will never be shaken.” 
>
><sup>7</sup> LORD, when you showed your favor, you made me stand like a strong mountain; when you hid your face, I was terrified. 
>
><sup>8</sup> LORD, I called to you; I sought favor from my Lord: 
>
><sup>9</sup> “What gain is there in my death, if I go down to the Pit? Will the dust praise you? Will it proclaim your truth? 
>
><sup>10</sup> LORD, listen and be gracious to me; LORD, be my helper.” 
>
><sup>11</sup> You turned my lament into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness, 
>
><sup>12</sup> so that I can sing to you and not be silent. LORD my God, I will praise you forever.
