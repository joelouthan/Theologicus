## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Living Word
</div>

All of your word
* points to you
* because it points through
* your only begotten Son.

So I pray that your Spirit
* whom dwells in me
* will guide me
* and bring me 
* all the way home
* to you.

Praise your name
* my Father
* my Savior
* my Spirit.

Amen.
