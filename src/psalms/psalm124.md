# Praying Through: Psalm 124

## The Psalm

>Psalm 124 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> A song of ascents. Of David. 
>
><sup>1</sup> If the LORD had not been on our side— let Israel say— 
>
><sup>2</sup> if the LORD had not been on our side when people attacked us, 
>
><sup>3</sup> then they would have swallowed us alive in their burning anger against us. 
>
><sup>4</sup> Then the water would have engulfed us; the torrent would have swept over us; 
>
><sup>5</sup> the raging water would have swept over us. 
>
><sup>6</sup> Blessed be the LORD, who has not let us be ripped apart by their teeth. 
>
><sup>7</sup> We have escaped like a bird from the hunter’s net; the net is torn, and we have escaped. 
>
><sup>8</sup> Our help is in the name of the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.

## The Prayer

<div style="font-variant: small-caps;">
My Savior
</div>

If I did not have you
* I would have perished
* in everlasting hell.

Yet you loved me
* so much
* you gave me your Son
* so I lift my eyes
* and see him
* and believe
* and now
* I live in your
* everlasting glory.

Be exalted, O God!
