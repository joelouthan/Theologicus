# Praying Through: Psalm 76 Righteous

## The Psalm

>Psalm 76 (CSB)  
><sup></sup> For the choir director: with stringed instruments. A psalm of Asaph. A song. 
>
><sup>1</sup> God is known in Judah; his name is great in Israel. 
>
><sup>2</sup> His tent is in Salem, his dwelling place in Zion. 
>
><sup>3</sup> There he shatters the bow’s flaming arrows, the shield, the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah 
>
><sup>4</sup> You are resplendent and majestic coming down from the mountains of prey. 
>
><sup>5</sup> The brave-hearted have been plundered; they have slipped into their final sleep. None of the warriors was able to lift a hand. 
>
><sup>6</sup> At your rebuke, God of Jacob, both chariot and horse lay still. 
>
><sup>7</sup> And you—you are to be feared. When you are angry, who can stand before you? 
>
><sup>8</sup> From heaven you pronounced judgment. The earth feared and grew quiet 
>
><sup>9</sup> when God rose up to judge and to save all the lowly of the earth. Selah 
>
><sup>10</sup> Even human wrath will praise you; you will clothe yourself with the wrath that remains. 
>
><sup>11</sup> Make and keep your vows to the LORD your God; let all who are around him bring tribute to the awe-inspiring one. 
>
><sup>12</sup> He humbles the spirit of leaders; he is feared by the kings of the earth.

## The Prayer

When I joined the rest of the world  
  to make war with you  
  I sit tight  
  under your mighty wraith  
  with every beat of my heart  
  because my heart knew nothing else  
  but wickedness and deceit towards you.

What I could never foreknew  
  is that before the mountains were formed  
  and time and space were spoken into existence  
  from everlasting to everlasting  
  you have sat your affections on me  
  and you bended time and circumstances  
  and you broke into our broken world  
  by the way of your Son  
  so that he would live and die for me  
  so that my sins--all of my wicked sins  
  would be buried in that tomb  
  and I would be resurrected  
  not just in life  
  but true life  
  forevermore.

Do what you must  
  to keep me close to you.
  I never want to be apart from you  
  because that is a hell  
  I never want to see again.

Amen.
