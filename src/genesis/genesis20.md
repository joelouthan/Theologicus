# Genesis 20 The Gospel Delivery

>Genesis 20 (CSB)  
><sup>1</sup> From there Abraham traveled to the region of the Negev and settled between Kadesh and Shur. While he was staying in Gerar, 
>
><sup>2</sup> Abraham said about his wife Sarah, “She is my sister.” So King Abimelech of Gerar had Sarah brought to him. 
>
><sup>3</sup> But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, “You are about to die because of the woman you have taken, for she is a married woman.” 
>
><sup>4</sup> Now Abimelech had not approached her, so he said, “Lord, would you destroy a nation even though it is innocent? 
>
><sup>5</sup> Didn’t he himself say to me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ I did this with a clear conscience and clean hands.” 
>
><sup>6</sup> Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that you did this with a clear conscience. I have also kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I have not let you touch her. 
>
><sup>7</sup> Now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return her, know that you will certainly die, you and all who are yours.” 
>
><sup>8</sup> Early in the morning Abimelech got up, called all his servants together, and personally told them all these things, and the men were terrified. 
>
><sup>9</sup> Then Abimelech called Abraham in and said to him, “What have you done to us? How did I sin against you that you have brought such enormous guilt on me and on my kingdom? You have done things to me that should never be done.” 
>
><sup>10</sup> Abimelech also asked Abraham, “What made you do this?” 
>
><sup>11</sup> Abraham replied, “I thought, ‘There is absolutely no fear of God in this place. They will kill me because of my wife.’ 
>
><sup>12</sup> Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife. 
>
><sup>13</sup> So when God had me wander from my father’s house, I said to her: Show your loyalty to me wherever we go and say about me, ‘He’s my brother.’ ” 
>
><sup>14</sup> Then Abimelech took flocks and herds and male and female slaves, gave them to Abraham, and returned his wife Sarah to him. 
>
><sup>15</sup> Abimelech said, “Look, my land is before you. Settle wherever you want.” 
>
><sup>16</sup> And he said to Sarah, “Look, I am giving your brother one thousand pieces of silver. It is a verification of your honor to all who are with you. You are fully vindicated.” 
>
><sup>17</sup> Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female slaves so that they could bear children, 
>
><sup>18</sup> for the LORD had completely closed all the wombs in Abimelech’s household on account of Sarah, Abraham’s wife.
